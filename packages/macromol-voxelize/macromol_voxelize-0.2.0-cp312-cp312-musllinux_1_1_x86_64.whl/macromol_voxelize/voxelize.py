Data structures and naming conventions
======================================
This list only includes data types that don't have their own classes.

`img`:
  A `np.ndarray` that contains the voxelized scene.

`atoms`:
  A `pandas.DataFrame` with the following columns: x, y, z, element.  This is 
  the way atoms are expected to be represented externally.  Internally, the 
  Atom data class is used to represent individual atoms.

`voxel`:
  A 3D `numpy.ndarray` containing the index for one of the cells in the image.  
  Generally, these indices are constrained to actually fall within the image in 
  question (i.e. no indices greater than the size of the image or less than 0).  
  Note that a `grid` object is needed to determine the physical location of the 
  voxel.  When multiple voxels are involved, the array has dimensions of (N,3).

`coords`:
  A 3D `numpy.ndarray` containing the location of the center of a voxel in 
  real-world coordinates, in units of Angstroms.  When multiple coordinates 
  that involved, the array has dimensions of (N,3).
"""

@dataclass
class ImageParams:
    """\
    A collection of parameters that apply to the image as a whole, as opposed
    to individual atoms.

    The most important parameters are `channels` and `grid`.  Together, these 
    specify the dimensions of the image.  The remaining parameters have 
    reasonable defaults.
    """

    channels: int
    """\
    The number of channels in the image.

    Note that this must be consistent with the *channels* column of the *atoms* 
    data frame passed to `image_from_atoms()`.  An error will be raised if any 
    atoms have channel indices that exceed the actual number of channels, or 
    are negative.

    The following data types are supported:

    - `np.float32`, a.k.a. `np.single`
    - `np.float64`, a.k.a. `np.double`

    Note that 64-bit (i.e. double-precision) floating point numbers are always 
    used for the intermediate calculations needed to fill in each voxel.  
    According to the overlap_ library, which implements most of these 
    calculations, "reducing the numerical precision of the scalar floating 
    point type will have a significant impact on the precision and stability of 
    the calculations".  Therefore, this setting only affects the precision used 
    to store the final result, and in turn the size of the final image.

    this can be slightly more efficient that assigning channels for every atom 
    in advance.
