Data structures and naming conventions
======================================
This list only includes data types that don't have their own classes.

`img`:
  A `np.ndarray` that contains the voxelized scene.

`atoms`:
  A `pandas.DataFrame` with the following columns: x, y, z, element.  This is 
  the way atoms are expected to be represented externally.  Internally, the 
  Atom data class is used to represent individual atoms.

`voxel`:
  A 3D `numpy.ndarray` containing the index for one of the cells in the image.  
  Generally, these indices are constrained to actually fall within the image in 
  question (i.e. no indices greater than the size of the image or less than 0).  
  Note that a `grid` object is needed to determine the physical location of the 
  voxel.  When multiple voxels are involved, the array has dimensions of (N,3).

`coords`:
  A 3D `numpy.ndarray` containing the location of the center of a voxel in 
  real-world coordinates, in units of Angstroms.  When multiple coordinates 
  that involved, the array has dimensions of (N,3).
"""

@dataclass
class ImageParams:
    """\
    A collection of parameters that apply to the image as a whole, as opposed
    to individual atoms.

    The most important parameters are `channels` and `grid`.  Together, these 
    specify the dimensions of the image.  The remaining parameters have 
    reasonable defaults.
    """

    channels: int
    """\
    The number of channels in the image.

    Note that this must be consistent with the *channels* column of the *atoms* 
    data frame passed to `image_from_atoms()`.  An error will be raised if any 
    atoms have channel indices that exceed the actual number of channels, or 
    are negative.
    """

    grid: Grid
    """\
    The spatial dimensions of the image.
    """

    dtype: type[np.floating] = np.float32
    """\
    The data type used to encode each voxel of the image.

    The following data types are supported:

    - `np.float32`, a.k.a. `np.single`
    - `np.float64`, a.k.a. `np.double`

    Note that 64-bit (i.e. double-precision) floating point numbers are always 
    used for the intermediate calculations needed to fill in each voxel.  
    According to the overlap_ library, which implements most of these 
    calculations, "reducing the numerical precision of the scalar floating 
    point type will have a significant impact on the precision and stability of 
    the calculations".  Therefore, this setting only affects the precision used 
    to store the final result, and in turn the size of the final image.
    """

    assign_channels: Callable[[pl.DataFrame], pl.DataFrame] = lambda x: x
    """\
    A function that can be used to assign channels the atoms being voxelized.

    This function is called after an initial filtering step that removes many 
    of the atoms that are too far away to be included in the image.  As such, 
    this can be slightly more efficient that assigning channels for every atom 
    in advance.  

    This function is passed the filtered *atoms* data frame and should return a 
    modified version of the same.  Do not modify any values in the *x*, *y*, 
    *z*, or *radius_A* columns, despite the possibility of doing so.  These 
    values have already been used in the aforementioned filtering steps, and 
    changing them here would lead to inconsistent results.

    Create an voxelized representation of the given atoms.

    Arguments:
        atoms:
            A dataframe representing the atoms to voxelize.  The following 
            columns are used to build the image.  Any other columns will be 
            silently ignored:

            - *x*, *y*, *z* (required): The center coordinates of each atom, in 
              units of angstroms.

            - *radius_A* (required): The radius of each atom, in units of

              create this column, if necessary.

            - *channels* (required): A list of integers specifying the channels 
              that each atom belongs to.  To be clear, each atom can belong to 
              any number of channels.  Each channel index must be between 0 and

              by `img_params.assign_channels` after an initial filtering step.

            - *occupancy* (optional): How "present" each atom is.  More 
              specifically, this is a factor that will be used to scale the 
              overlap between the atom and each voxel.  If not specified, an

            includes the dimensions of the image.

    Returns:
        A floating point array of dimension $(C, X, Y, Z)$, where $C$ is 
        the number of channels specified by `img_params.channels` and $X$, $Y$,

    #   arrays have to be transposed when moving from one language to the 
    #   other.  In principle, it would be possible to use the same row/column 
    #   vector convention in both languages.  But this would make it harder to 
    #   interact with third-party libraries like `overlap`.

    # - Eigen doesn't have 1D arrays.  Instead it has vectors, which are just 
    #   2D matrices with either 1 row or 1 column.  When converting a vector 
    #   from C++/Eigen back to python/numpy, it's not clear whether the

    #   looking at the shape of the original numpy input.

    # code itself.  The main reason for exposing most of the C++ functions to 
    # python is testing, and for that it's not helpful to be changing the
