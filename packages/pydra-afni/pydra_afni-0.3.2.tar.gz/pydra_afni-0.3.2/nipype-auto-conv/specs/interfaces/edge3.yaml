# This file is used to manually specify the semi-automatic conversion of
# 'nipype.interfaces.afni.utils.Edge3' from Nipype to Pydra.
#
# Please fill-in/edit the fields below where appropriate
#
# Inputs
# ------
# in_file : file
#    input file to 3dedge3
# out_file : file
#    output image file name
# datum : enum
#    specify data type for output. Valid types are 'byte', 'short' and 'float'.
# fscale : bool
#    Force scaling of the output to the maximum integer range.
# gscale : bool
#    Same as '-fscale', but also forces each output sub-brick to to get the same scaling factor.
# nscale : bool
#    Don't do any scaling on output to byte or short datasets.
# scale_floats : float
#    Multiply input by VAL, but only if the input datum is float. This is needed when the input dataset has a small range, like 0 to 2.0 for instance. With such a range, very few edges are detected due to what I suspect to be truncation problems. Multiplying such a dataset by 10000 fixes the problem and the scaling is undone at the output.
# verbose : bool
#    Print out some information along the way.
# num_threads : int
#    set number of threads
# outputtype : enum
#    AFNI output filetype
# args : str
#    Additional parameters to the command
# environ : dict
#    Environment variables
#
# Outputs
# -------
# out_file : file
#    output file

  callables:
  # dict[str, str] - names of methods/callable classes defined in the adjacent `*_callables.py`

  templates:
  # dict[str, str] - `output_file_template` values to be provided to output fields
  requirements:
  # dict[str, list[str]] - input fields that are required to be provided for the output field to be present

  # these values will be ignored, when running in CI
  timeout: 10
  # int - the value to set for the timeout in the generated test, 
  # after which the test will be considered to have been initialised 
  # successfully. Set to 0 to disable the timeout (warning, this could
  # lead to the unittests taking a very long time to complete)

  # when you are satisfied with the edits you have made to this file
doctests:
- cmdline: 3dedge3 -input functional.nii -datum byte -prefix edges.nii

  inputs:

  # If the field is of file-format type and the value is None, then the
  # '.mock()' method of the corresponding class is used instead.
