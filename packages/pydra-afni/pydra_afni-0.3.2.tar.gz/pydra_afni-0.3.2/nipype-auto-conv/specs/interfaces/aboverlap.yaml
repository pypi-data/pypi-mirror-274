# Output (to screen) is a count of various things about how
#     the automasks of datasets A and B overlap or don't overlap.

  callables:
  # dict[str, str] - names of methods/callable classes defined in the adjacent `*_callables.py`

  templates:
  # dict[str, str] - `output_file_template` values to be provided to output fields
  requirements:
  # dict[str, list[str]] - input fields that are required to be provided for the output field to be present

- inputs:

  # dict[str, str] - expected values for selected outputs, noting that tests will typically
  # be terminated before they complete for time-saving reasons, and therefore
  # these values will be ignored, when running in CI
  timeout: 10
  # int - the value to set for the timeout in the generated test, 
  # after which the test will be considered to have been initialised 
  # successfully. Set to 0 to disable the timeout (warning, this could
  # lead to the unittests taking a very long time to complete)

  # bool - whether the unittest is expected to fail or not. Set to false
  # when you are satisfied with the edits you have made to this file
doctests:
- cmdline: 3dABoverlap functional.nii structural.nii |& tee out.mask_ae_overlap.txt
  # str - the expected cmdline output
  inputs:
  # dict[str, str] - name-value pairs for inputs to be provided to the doctest.
  # If the field is of file-format type and the value is None, then the
  # '.mock()' method of the corresponding class is used instead.
