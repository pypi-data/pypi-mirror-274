# This file is used to manually specify the semi-automatic conversion of
# 'nipype.interfaces.afni.utils.AFNItoNIFTI' from Nipype to Pydra.
#
# Please fill-in/edit the fields below where appropriate
#
# Inputs
# ------
# in_file : file
#    input file to 3dAFNItoNIFTI
# out_file : file
#    output image file name
# pure : bool
#    Do NOT write an AFNI extension field into the output file. Only use this option if needed. You can also use the 'nifti_tool' program to strip extensions from a file.
# denote : bool
#    When writing the AFNI extension field, remove text notes that might contain subject identifying information.
# oldid : bool
#    Give the new dataset the input datasets AFNI ID code.
# newid : bool
#    Give the new dataset a new AFNI ID code, to distinguish it from the input dataset.
# num_threads : int
#    set number of threads
# outputtype : enum
#    AFNI output filetype
# args : str
#    Additional parameters to the command
# environ : dict
#    Environment variables
#
# Outputs
# -------
# out_file : file
#    output file
#
# Docs
# ----
# Converts AFNI format files to NIFTI format. This can also convert 2D or
#     1D data, which you can numpy.squeeze() to remove extra dimensions.
# 
#     For complete details, see the `3dAFNItoNIFTI Documentation.
#     <https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/program_help/3dAFNItoNIFTI.html>`_
# 
#     Examples
#     --------
#     >>> from nipype.interfaces import afni
#     >>> a2n = afni.AFNItoNIFTI()
#     >>> a2n.inputs.in_file = 'afni_output.3D'
#     >>> a2n.inputs.out_file =  'afni_output.nii'
#     >>> a2n.cmdline
#     '3dAFNItoNIFTI -prefix afni_output.nii afni_output.3D'
#     >>> res = a2n.run()  # doctest: +SKIP
