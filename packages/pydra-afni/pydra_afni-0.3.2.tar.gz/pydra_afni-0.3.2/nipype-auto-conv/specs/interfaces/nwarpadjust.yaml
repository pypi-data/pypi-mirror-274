# Inputs
# ------
# warps : inputmultiobject
#    List of input 3D warp datasets
# in_files : inputmultiobject
#    List of input 3D datasets to be warped by the adjusted warp datasets.  There must be exactly as many of these datasets as there are input warps.
# out_file : file
#    Output mean dataset, only needed if in_files are also given. The output dataset will be on the common grid shared by the source datasets.
# num_threads : int
#    set number of threads
# outputtype : enum
#    AFNI output filetype
# args : str
#    Additional parameters to the command
# environ : dict

# This program takes as input a bunch of 3D warps, averages them,
#     and computes the inverse of this average warp.  It then composes
#     each input warp with this inverse average to 'adjust' the set of
#     warps.  Optionally, it can also read in a set of 1-brick datasets
#     corresponding to the input warps, and warp each of them, and average
#     those.
# 
#     For complete details, see the `3dNwarpAdjust Documentation.
