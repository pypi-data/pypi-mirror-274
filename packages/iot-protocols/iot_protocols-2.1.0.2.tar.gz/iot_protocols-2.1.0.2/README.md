# Iot Protocols

This git contains easy to use module for communication using various IIoT protocols.
Each subdirectory is a package that can be used independently and downloaded from PyPi.

## Install

```bash
pip install <name-of-package>
```

## Upload on Twine

### Upload pyporject.toml

> **More detailled informations on** <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/>

Open the pyproject.toml file and update at least the _version_ field with your current verion following the template :

```bash
For alpha release : <version>.<subversion>.<feature>.<fix>-a<i>
For beta release : <version>.<subversion>.<feature>.<fix>-b<i>
For relase candidate release : <version>.<subversion>.<feature>.<fix>-rc<i>
For final release : <version>.<subversion>.<feature>.<fix>
```

With the following :

- \<version\> defines the core version of the application. This number increase when drastic changes havec been made.
- \<subversion> defines important changes like addition of modules or large modification but that doesn't change the global structure of the package.
- \<feature> defines an addition of any feature.
- \<fix> increase when a fix has been made.

### Save your changes

Save everything.

Test everyting.

Push the files on the gitlab repository with version associated TAG.

### Build the package

Ensure you have upgraded pip:

```bash
py -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

Then from the root directory of your module, where the **pyproject.toml** file belongs, execute :

```bash
py -m build
```

This will generate your package tar.gz and wheel files into the **build** folder.

### Upload the dist

First ensure you have twine updated:

```bash
py -m pip install --upgrade twine
```

Get your username and token from PyPi

Use the following command to upload and gives your username and token to authentify, with username as '\_\_token\_\_':

```bashpy -m twine upload dist/<package-file-to-update>
```

You can also, if the build package doesn't exists yet on the PyPi registry use :

```bash
py -m twine upload dist/*
```

## How to use

### Installation

```shell
pip install iot-protocols
```

### Modbus Client

```python
from iot_protocols.modbus import ModbusClient
from iot_protocols.modbus import requests

client = ModbusClient.with_serial_client(port: "/dev/ttyO3", method: "rtu", baudrate: 9600, parity: "N", stopbits: 1, bytesize: 8, timeout: int = 5)

request = requests.ReadHoldingRegister(address=30000, unit=1, count=6, encoding="str")
result = client.request(request)
```

### IEC62056 Client

```python
from iot_protocols.iec62056 import SerialClient

client = SerialClient(
    baudrate=19200,
    port="COM3",
    transport="serial",
    parity="E",
    bytesize=7,
    stopbits=1
)
result = client.request(device_addres="xxxxx", table=0 timeout=15)
# If you just want to read the client's identification message :
identification = client.read_tariff_identification(device_addres="xxxxx", ack_stop=True)
```

### Snap-7 Client
