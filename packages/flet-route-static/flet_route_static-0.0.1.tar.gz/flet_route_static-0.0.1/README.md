# This makes it easy to manage multiple views with dynamic routing.

This is an utility class based on repath library which allows matching ExpressJS-like routes and parsing their parameters, for example `/account/:account_id/orders/:order_id`.

## Differences from flet-route
- Flet-Route-Static is made to work with Flet Static Websites. The standard Flet-Route Package does not support this at the moment.
- Changes:
    - Removed `repath`  dependency.
    - Removed `flet` dependency (Static websites install `flet-pyodide` by itself)
    - Removed `CLI` commands (Does not need to be available in static websites)

## Installation
```
pip install flet-route-static
```

## Upgradation
```
pip install flet-route-static --upgrade
```
