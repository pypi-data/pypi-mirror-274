# euc2mqtt

[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/islandcontroller/euc2mqtt)](LICENSE) ![PyPI - Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/euc2mqtt)

A tool for publishing status data from a local Eaton UPS Companion service to Homeassistant.

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/islandcontroller/euc2mqtt/master/scr.png"/></p>

## Quick Start

The following quick start guide should get you up and running from a blank Homeassistant installation. Feel free to skip a step if your system is already configured.

### Install mosquitto

1. In Homeassistant, navigate to *Settings*, *Add-ons*
2. Click the *Add-on store* button
3. Search for *Mosquitto broker* and select the result
4. Click on *Install*

> [!NOTE]
> When using the *Mosquitto broker* Add-on, your MQTT broker hostname will be the same as your Homeassistant's, e.g. "`homeassistant.local`".

### Create a new Homeassistant user for data ingest

As mosquitto requires authentication, I heavily suggest creating a new user for data ingest.

1. In Homeassistant, navigate to *Settings*, *People*
2. Click on *Add person*, input a user name
3. Check *Allow person to log in*
4. Enter all required fields
5. Check *Can only log in from local network*

### Get the application

Windows binaries are provided on the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/islandcontroller/euc2mqtt/releases) page.

If you prefer to use your own Python insallation, a pre-built package is hosted on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/euc2mqtt/) and can be installed and updated using the [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/getting-started/) utility:

    pip install -U euc2mqtt

### Run it!

> [!NOTE]
> This tool needs to run on the same host as Eaton UPS Companion, as EUC in its default configuration only accepts connections on `localhost:4679`.

Open a terminal and run the tool, providing the broker hostname (your Homeassistant hostname), username and the password!

*Option 1: Standalone application*

    .\euc2mqtt --mqtt <broker hostname> --username <user> --password <password>

*Option 2: Run as Python module*

    python -m euc2mqtt --mqtt <broker hostname> --username <user> --password <password>

### More info

A more in-depth description of available command line parameters can be viewed by appending `-h` at the end of your input. For example:

```
> .\euc2mqtt -h

usage: euc2mqtt [-h] [--name NAME] [--mqtt MQTT] [--euc EUC] [--username USERNAME] [--password PASSWORD] [--interval INTERVAL] [--full-update FULL_UPDATE] [--logfile LOGFILE] [--verbose]

MQTT Publisher for Eaton UPS Companion status messages to Home Assistant. See https://github.com/islandcontroller/euc2mqtt for more info!

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --name NAME           Device name
  --mqtt MQTT           MQTT broker hostname and port (hostname[:port])
  --euc EUC             Eaton UPS Companion hostname and port (hostname[:port])
  --username USERNAME   Username for MQTT broker authentication
  --password PASSWORD   Password for MQTT broker authentication
  --interval INTERVAL   Update interval in seconds
  --full-update FULL_UPDATE
                        Number of incremental dataset fetches between full updates
  --logfile LOGFILE     Output log messages to a file
  --verbose             Enable verbose logging
```

## Running as a Windows Task

1. Open *Task Scheduler* and select *Create New Task...*
2. Select the following options on the *General* tab:
    - Check *Run whether user is logged in or not*
    - Uncheck *Do not store password*
3. On the *Triggers* tab, create a "At startup" trigger
4. On the *Actions* tab, add the standalone application as a program to run:
    - Action: *Start a program*
    - Program/Script: (Navigate to your `euc2mqtt.exe` here)
    - Add arguments: `--mqtt <broker hostname> --username <user> --password <password>`
5. On the *Settings* tab, select the following options:
    - Check *Allow task to be run on demand*
    - Select *If task fails, restart every: 1 minute*
    - Uncheck *Stop the task if it runs longer than: ...*
    - Select *If the task is already running: Do not start a new instance*
6. Click *OK*. You will be prompted for a username and password to run the task as.

## Configuring bind address for Eaton UPS Companion

> [!WARNING]
> Exposing the EUC service may pose a security risk.

> [!NOTE]
> When euc2mqtt is run on the same host as EUC, it is not required to expose the EUC service.

1. Start a `notepad` instance with Admin privileges
2. Open `C:\Program Files (x86)\Eaton\UPSCompanion\configs\config.js`
3. Edit the "`httpServers`" line to listen on all interfaces:

        "httpServers": {"http": {"port": 4679, "hostname": "0.0.0.0"}},
