# euc2mqtt

[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/islandcontroller/euc2mqtt)](LICENSE) ![PyPI - Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/euc2mqtt)

A tool for publishing status data from a local Eaton UPS Companion service to Homeassistant.

<p align="center"><img src="scr.png"/></p>

## Quick Start

The following quick start guide should get you up and running from a blank Homeassistant installation. Feel free to skip a step if your system is already configured.

### Install mosquitto

1. In Homeassistant, navigate to *Settings*, *Add-ons*
2. Click the *Add-on store* button
3. Search for *Mosquitto broker* and select the result
4. Click on *Install*

### Create a new Homeassistant user for data ingest

As mosquitto requires authentication, I heavily suggest creating a new user for data ingest.

1. In Homeassistant, navigate to *Settings*, *People*
2. Click on *Add person*, input a user name
3. Check *Allow person to log in*
4. Enter all required fields
5. Check *Can only log in from local network*

### Get the application

Windows binaries are provided on the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/islandcontroller/euc2mqtt/releases) page.**

If you prefer to use your own Python insallation, a pre-built package is hosted on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/euc2mqtt/) and can be installed and updated using the [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/getting-started/) utility:

    pip install -U euc2mqtt

### Run it!

> [!NOTE]
> This tool needs to run on the same host as Eaton UPS Companion, as EUC in its default configuration only accepts connections on `localhost:4679`.

Open a terminal and run the tool, providing the broker hostname (your Homeassistant hostname), username and the password!

*Option 1: Standalone application*

    .\euc2mqtt --mqtt <broker hostname> --username <user> --password <password>

*Option 2: Run as Python module*

    python -m euc2mqtt --mqtt <broker hostname> --username <user> --password <password>

### More info

A more in-depth description of available command line parameters can be viewed by appending `-h` at the end of your input. For example:

```
> .\euc2mqtt -h

usage: euc2mqtt [-h] [--name NAME] [--mqtt MQTT] [--euc EUC] [--username USERNAME] [--password PASSWORD] [--interval INTERVAL] [--full-update FULL_UPDATE] [--logfile LOGFILE] [--verbose]
