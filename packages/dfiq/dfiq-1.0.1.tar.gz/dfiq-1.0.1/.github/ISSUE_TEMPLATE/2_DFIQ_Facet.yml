        # DFIQ: Facets

        
        Facets are used for intermediate-level grouping in DFIQ. A particular Facet 
        can be part of multiple different Scenarios and will contain multiple Questions. 
        A Facet breaks the larger Scenario into smaller logical pieces, but a Facet 
        is still too broad to answer directly; it must also be broken down (into Questions).


        ## Fields from the DFIQ Specification

        
        The following fields are based on the [DFIQ Specification](https://dfiq.org/spec). 
        The required fields are marked, but filling out as many as you can now will make 
        creating the DFIQ YAML file easier later.
