        # DFIQ: Questions

        
        Questions are the fundamental "building blocks" of DFIQ. All other DFIQ 
        components are relative to Questions: Approaches describe how to answer 
        the Questions, and Scenarios and Facets organize the Questions logically.


        A Question should be specific enough that it can be readily answered 
        and not easily divided into multiple parts (if it can be, it likely 
        should be multiple Questions). A single Question can be reused in 
        multiple different Facets.

        ## Fields from the DFIQ Specification

        
        The following fields are based on the [DFIQ Specification](https://dfiq.org/spec). 
        The required fields are marked, but filling out as many as you can now will make 
        creating the DFIQ YAML file easier later.

        ## Helpful Additional Information

        the proposed Question.
