        # DFIQ: Scenarios

        
        A Scenario is the highest-level grouping in DFIQ. A Scenario is made of 
        one or more Facets (different "sides" of an investigation), which in 
        turn are made up of investigative Questions.


        ## Fields from the DFIQ Specification

        
        The following fields are based on the [DFIQ Specification](https://dfiq.org/spec). 
        The required fields are marked, but filling out as many as you can now will make 
        creating the DFIQ YAML file easier later.
