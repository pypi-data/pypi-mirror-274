TimeChart
=====================================
TimeChart is a Python Qt-based graphing application for control systems. It is intended to be a charting tool that is
cross-platform, responsive, and has a clean, intuitive, and easy-to-use UI.

TimeChart draws its charting capability from `pyqtgraph <https://github.com/pyqtgraph/pyqtgraph>`_, and the TimePlot
widget, where the charts are displayed, is provided by the `Python Display Manager (PyDM)
<https://github.com/slaclab/pydm>`_ widget collection.
