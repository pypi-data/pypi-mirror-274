Martinoid2.py is a script to create Coarse Grain Martinoid 
input files of peptoids, ready for use in the molecular 
dynamics simulations package Gromacs.\n
Primary input/output
--------------------
Martinoid2.py [sequence] [Flags] [Secondary Structure]\n\n
Sequence             -- Written using the Glasgow convention (https://doi.org/10.17868/strath.00085559)
                        with a '-' spacer between each molecules (Example: tri sarcosine would be 'Na-Na-Na').\n\n
Flags                 - Martinoid allows users to explicitly set termini backbone charge states:\n
                        -nt  : is a neutral N- terminus with hydrogen bonding acceptor and donor character.
                        -ntc : is an acetylated N-terminus with only hydrogen bonding acceptor character.
                        -ct  : is a neutral carboxylate C-terminus.
                        -ctc : is a charged carboxylate C-terminus with acceptor character\n
                        If no flag is provided then the script defaults to a charged donor N-terminus (Qd) and a
                        non-polar amidated C-terminus (Nda) which reflects many cases in the literature.\n\n
Secondary Structure --  Martinoid version 1.0 has two secondary structure options for sequences longer than trimers: 
                        'Linear' and 'Helical'. The former has a loose linear backbone dihedral while the latter has
                        rigid angle/dihedrals to enforce a Right Handed (RH) helix. Additional secondary structures 
                        are planned for future versions.\n
Output              --  Martinoid will produce an *itp and *pdb file for the given structure. The *itp file is ready 
                        to use with the molecule name "Peptoid" which can be used as a t-coupling group. The *pdb
                        structure will require minimization/equilibration prior to use, though is adequate for system
                        construction.\n 
Directory Structure
----------------   
To function correctly "Martinoid2.py" must be in the directory above ~/Data and in the same directory as "_martinoid_data.py".
We have found it useful to make sub-dirs within a "Martinoid" directory, generate *itp files in these and then reference to these 
from elsewhere in the file system. 
                
Additional Notes
----------------     
The popular chiral residues (Nfes/Nfer), for which handedness is lost through coarse graining, are represented by a single monomer 
'Nfex' which reproduces their non-bonded character through bead type selection. The sarcosine monomer, Na, has the resname 'Nx' because
Gromacs interprets 'Na' as an ion and then proceeds to cause drama.\n
