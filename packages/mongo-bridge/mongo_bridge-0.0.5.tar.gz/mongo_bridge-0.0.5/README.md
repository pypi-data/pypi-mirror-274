# Mongo Bridge

Mongo Bridge is a Python package designed to simplify the process of connecting to MongoDB Atlas and performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It offers a high-level API for interacting with MongoDB databases, making it easier to manage database operations within your Python applications.

## Installation

You can install Mongo Bridge via pip:

\`\`\`bash
pip install mongo-bridge
\`\`\`

## Usage

To start using Mongo Bridge, follow these steps:

1. **Import the \`mongodb_operation\` function from \`mongo_bridge\` module:**

    \`\`\`python
    from mongo_bridge import mongodb_operation
    \`\`\`

2. **Configure your MongoDB Atlas connection:**

    Replace the placeholders \`<username>\`, \`<password>\`, \`<cluster-url>\`, \`<app-name>\`, \`<database-name>\`, and \`<collection-name>\` with your actual MongoDB Atlas details.

    \`\`\`python
    client_url = "mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-url>/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=<app-name>"
    database = "<database-name>"
    collection_name = "<collection-name>"
    \`\`\`

3. **Create a new client and connect to the server:**

    \`\`\`python
    mongo = mongodb_operation(client_url, database, collection_name)
    \`\`\`
