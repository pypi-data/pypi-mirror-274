## Overview

<p align="center">
Send notification once long-running command is finished and also show the execution time.
</p>

## Installation

To install use pip:

``` bash
xpip install xontrib-cmd-durations
# or: xpip install -U git+https://github.com/jnoortheen/xontrib-cmd-durations
```

## Usage

Add the `long_cmd_duration` section to the [prompt fields](https://xon.sh/tutorial.html#customizing-the-prompt) and load the xontrib i.e.:

``` bash
$RIGHT_PROMPT = '{long_cmd_duration:âŒ›{}}{user:{{BOLD_RED}}ðŸ¤–{}}{hostname:{{BOLD_#FA8072}}ðŸ–¥{}}'
$XONTRIB_CD_LONG_DURATION = 5  # default
xontrib load cmd_done
```

If the command is taking more than `$XONTRIB_CD_LONG_DURATION` seconds then `long_cmd_duration` returns the duration in human readable way:

The desktop notification is sent if the terminal is not focused:

Currently the focusing part requires `xdotool` to be installed.

## Known issues

### Notifications in Windows
On windows the notification will get triggered all the time. 
`Finding whether the terminal is focused` is not implemented for Windows yet and PRs are very welcome on that.
Set `$XONTRIB_CD_TRIGGER_NOTIFICATION = False` to completely off the notification part.

### Notifications in MacOS

If you want to change the app name in notification in MacOS you can use `$XONTRIB_CD_NOTIFICATION_APP_NAME` environment variable with [automatically replaced keywords](https://xon.sh/tutorial.html#customizing-the-prompt):
```xsh
$XONTRIB_CD_NOTIFICATION_APP_NAME = '{user}@{hostname}:{cwd}'
$RIGHT_PROMPT = '{long_cmd_duration}'
xontrib load cmd_done

sleep 6
# Switch to another window
```
Result:
