              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

# Reynard the Robot

Documentation can be found at: [https://reynard-the-robot.readthedocs.io/](https://reynard-the-robot.readthedocs.io/)

Reynard the Robot is a tool designed to help new users learn Robot Raconteur. It is designed to
provide a simple experience like the classic "Turtle" application, but with a robotics spin. Reynard is
a cartoon planar mobile robot with an attached articulated arm. He can be translated in X and Y in the plane,
and the arm has three revolute joints. For simplicity, Reynard cannot be rotated in the plane. In total,
Reynard has 5 degrees of freedom.

The application also has a simple chat window, where Reynard can send and receive messages to the user.

The color of the robot base can be changed. The default is an orange color, but the color can be changed to any
RGB value.

The software interface is designed to be representative of real devices, and provide a simple way
for users to begin using Robot Raconteur.

<p align="center"><img src="docs/figures/reynard_the_robot.png"></p>

The application is implemented as a simple Web application. By default the Reynard application runs a simple
web server on port 29201. Open a web browser to `http://localhost:29201` to view the user interface. Replace
`localhost` with the IP address of the computer running the application, and use the `--http-public` option.
A simple GUI is also available that can be enabled by passing the `--gui` command line option.
The GUI is implemented using PySide6. The `pyside6` Python package must be installed to use the GUI.
Install Reynard using the package `pip install reynard-the-robot[gui]` to install the GUI along with the application.

By default, the Reynard Robot Raconteur service is available at `rr+tcp://localhost:29200/?service=reynard`.

Reynard is also designed to help users learn how to develop Robot Raconteur drivers. The application provides
the following software programming interfaces:

- Robot Raconteur
- Python Library API
- HTTP REST API
- Raw ASCII Socket
- ROS 1 (external package required)
- ROS 2 (external package required)

These interfaces are designed to be representative of real devices. Robot Raconteur drivers communicates with
the device using one of these (or similar) interfaces, and provides a Robot Raconteur service.

The ROS 1 and ROS 2 interfaces require external packages to operate. See
https://github.com/johnwason/reynard_the_robot_ros and https://github.com/johnwason/reynard_the_robot_ros2

## Installation

### Installer for Windows

Reynard the Robot is available as an installer for Windows. See
https://github.com/robotraconteur/reynard-the-robot/releases for the current release. Download the appropriate file,
and install as normal. These installers use the PySide6 based viewer. Shortcut icons are created
under the "Robot Raconteur" group on Windows. Windows may raise security warnings. If these are a problem,
use the `pip` method below. By default the shortcut will start Reynard in GUI mode.

*Note: Currently the Windows Installer will raise several security warnings. These are due to the installer not being
signed. The software is safe to install. Future versions will be signed. If these warnings are a problem, use the `pip`
method below.*

If headless mode or other advanced
options are required, use the `pip` method.

### Python Pip

`reynard-the-robot` requires Python 3.8 or higher. Install using:

```
python -m pip install --user reynard-the-robot
```

If the GUI is desired, install using:

```
python -m pip install --user reynard-the-robot[gui]
```

On Linux and Mac OS, use:

```
python3 -m pip install --user reynard-the-robot
```

If the GUI is desired, install using:

```
python3 -m pip install --user reynard-the-robot[gui]
```

The GUI is not currently working on Mac OS.

## Usage

### Installer Shortcuts

If the installer is used, simply use the shortcut icons to start Reynard the Robot.

### Command Line

```
reynard-the-robot [options]
```

Or use Python module invocation if the entrypoint does not work:

```
python3 -m reynard_the_robot [options]
```

Available options:

Here is the markdown documentation for the arguments:

- `--gui` - Run Reynard with a GUI. Requires the `pyside6` package to be installed.
- `--disable-robotraconteur` - Disable Robot Raconteur service
- `--disable-ascii-socket` - Disable ASCII socket server
- `--http-public` - Use public IP for HTTP socket server. If omitted, only localhost connections are accepted
- `--http-port=` - Port for HTTP socket server. Default value is 29201
- `--ascii-socket-public` - Use public IP for ASCII socket server. If omitted, only localhost connections are accepted
- `--ascii-socket-port=` - Port for ASCII socket server. Default value is 29202
- `--quiet` - Suppress output

Standard Robot Raconteur command line options can also be used. See
https://github.com/robotraconteur/robotraconteur/wiki/Command-Line-Options


## Client Usage

Multiple client interfaces are provided. See the following pages for more information on each interface:

- Robot Raconteur [docs/robotraconteur.md](docs/robotraconteur.md)
- Python API [https://reynard-the-robot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference.html](https://reynard-the-robot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference.html)
- HTTP REST API [docs/http_rest.md](docs/http_rest.md)
- Raw ASCII Socket [docs/socket.md](docs/socket.md)
- ROS 1 and ROS 2 [docs/ros.md](docs/ros.md)

Note that the ROS 1 and ROS 2 interfaces require external packages to operate. See [docs/ros.md](docs/ros.md)
for more information.
