ipywidgets holds each instantiated widget independently, and they aren't released to the
garbage collector until their `close` method has been called and there are no further
references to their instance.

If we're not careful, this can lead to a massive bloat of the registered widgets and
memory strain. Here, we introduce a abstract class to help manage the closure of the
widgets we create.
