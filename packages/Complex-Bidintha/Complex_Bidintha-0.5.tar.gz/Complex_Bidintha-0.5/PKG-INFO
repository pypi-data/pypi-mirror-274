The ComplexNumbers package provides a simple implementation of complex numbers in Python. It includes a `Complex` class with support for basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of complex numbers. Additionally, the class provides methods for calculating the absolute value (magnitude) of a complex number and comparing complex numbers for equality and inequality.

## Features

- Implements complex numbers with real and imaginary parts.
- Supports arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Provides methods for absolute value calculation and comparison.
- Designed for simplicity and ease of use.

## Installation

You can install the ComplexNumbers package using pip:

```bash
pip install Complex_Bidintha
