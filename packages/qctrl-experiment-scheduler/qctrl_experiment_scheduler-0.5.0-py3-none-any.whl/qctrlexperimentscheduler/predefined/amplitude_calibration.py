class AmplitudeCalibrationBackend:
    r"""
    An abstract class for the backends where you can use the predefined
    amplitude calibration graph.

    Backends are interfaces with either external hardware like IBM-Q or
    Rigetti, or a simulator that uses Boulder Opal. The constructor of
    the backend can take all the parameters that are exclusive for a
    certain interface. For example, an IBM-Q backend can take the user's
    IBM credentials, while a simulation backend will include the Boulder
    Opal session and parameters like the amount of noise to be simulated.

    The methods of this class contain all the operations that an
    amplitude calibration requires. Specifically, it needs the capability
    of performing three kinds of experiments:

    1. A repetition of N :math:`\pi`-pulses followed by a measurement.
    2. A repetition of N :math:`\pi/2`-pulses followed by a measurement.
    3. One :math:`\pi/2`-pulse followed by N :math:`\pi`-pulses and a measurement.

    Each of these functions should take the parameters of the Gaussian
    pulses used (amplitude and DRAG coefficient) as well as the number of
    repetitions N of each experiment. The result is then returned in the
    form of the fraction of the results in the state :math:`|1\rangle`.

    """
    Perform the fine amplitude calibration of the pi/2 pulse in the backend provided.

    It performs a series of repetition experiments of the pi/2 pulse.
    For a perfect pi/2 pulse, the populations would oscillate with a
    frequency of pi/4 of the number of pulses. Any deviations from this
    frequency are used to correct the current estimate of the pi/2 pulse
    amplitude.

    Most of the experiments use an odd number of repetitions as a way of
    keeping the results away from the minima and maxima of the oscillations,
    making it easier to differentiate an over-rotation from an under-rotation.
    The initial points also include even numbers as a way to get a sense
    of the amplitude of the oscillations. With few repetitions, it is less
    likely that errors will accumulate, and the points are more likely to
    actually coincide with maxima and minima.

    Data analysis is then performed to determine how much the frequency
    of oscillation differs from the expected one.

    The initial pi/2 pulse has the role of putting the results close to the
    0.5 value, as staying away from the maxima and minima allows us to
    more easily identify if something is an under-rotation or an over-rotation.

    This calibration graph contains three nodes. The root node is a coarse

    both the :math:`\pi` and the :math:`\pi/2` pulses. The subsequent nodes use these two
    values of the coarse calibration of the amplitudes for the fine
