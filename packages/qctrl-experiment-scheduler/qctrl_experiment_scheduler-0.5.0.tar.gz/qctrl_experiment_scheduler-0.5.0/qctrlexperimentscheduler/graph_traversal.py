def _recursive_recalibration(

    """
    Rerun the calibration of the dependency tree of the current node.

    This protocol runs a check data experiment for the node provided. If it
    fails, it runs the same protocol in all the dependencies. If after this
    the current node is not in a success state, it forces a recalibration of
    the current node as well.

    Parameters
    ----------
    calibration_graph : CalibrationGraph
        The calibration graph that contains the calibration tasks to be
        performed.
    node : CalibrationNode
        The node whose state you want to recalibrate.
    verbosity : Verbosity
        The verbosity of messages when running calculations.

    Notes
    -----
    This protocol is very much analogous to the `diagnose` function of the
    Optimus algorithm [1], with the difference that a recalibration is run at
    the end even if none of the dependencies recalibrated, as long as the
    node is not in SUCCESS state. This is to make sure that even nodes
    without dependencies are recalibrated, if necessary.

    Part of the Optimus algorithm that checks the sanity of the dependency tree.

    Check if all of the following are true for this node and all the nodes
    in its dependency tree, after checking if they have timed out:
    1. They are in a SUCCESS state.
    2. None of their dependencies have been calibrated more recently than
       the node itself.

    This function only mutates the state of the node if they have timed
    out.

    Parameters
    ----------
    calibration_graph : CalibrationGraph
        The graph the dependency tree belongs to.

    Run an adapted version of the Optimus "maintain" algorithm.

    Pass the node that you want to calibrate, and the algorithm will rerun
    the nodes that it depends on, if they aren't in a success state, or if
    any of the nodes in their dependency tree have recalibrated sooner than
    nodes that are further up in the dependency tree.

    Parameters
    ----------
    calibration_graph : CalibrationGraph
        The calibration graph that contains the calibration tasks to be
        performed.
    node : CalibrationNode
        The node whose state is being checked.
    verbosity : Verbosity
        The verbosity of messages when running calculations.

    Notes
    -----
    This implementation is very similar to the `maintain` function of
    the Optimus algorithm [1]. The main difference is that it calls the
    equivalent of the `diagnose` function in the top-level node as well,
    which may cause it to recalibrate before the end of the `maintain`.
    To make sure we're not duplicating calibrations, we check the status
    of the node at the end before proceeding.
