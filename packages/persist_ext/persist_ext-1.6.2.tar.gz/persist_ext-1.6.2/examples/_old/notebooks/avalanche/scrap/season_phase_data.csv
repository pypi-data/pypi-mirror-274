They ascended a North-South running ridge on Mt Aire and experienced at least one collapse in low angle terrain during the approach. They skied an East aspect off the ridge and did not report any collapsing or cracking. They switched to the West side of the ridge on a slope with a NW aspect. Skier 1 descended and continued to the trailhead. Skier 2 triggered the slide, but skier 1 did not know this. Skier 2 was caught and carried approximately 75 feet downhill to some trees but was not buried and not injured. Skier 3 descended to perform a rescue.

Skier 2 was ok. Because they did not see skier 1, they assumed he was buried. They performed a beacon search but did not receive a signal. They reported that Skier 1 had been having some sort of trouble with his beacon this year; therefore, they assumed he was buried but his beacon was not working. At that point, they called 911 to get help. With no beacon signal, Skier's 2 & 3 and began probing areas with a high probability of burial (like the uphill side of trees). They scoured every inch of debris continuing to probe all likely areas. As they worked closer to the toe of the debris, they spotted skier 1's ski tracks which were not obvious. They followed his tracks to the trail head and discovered he was ok. While skiing back to the trail head, another avalanche was triggered on buried surface hoar.

We at the UAC are all very happy no one was injured or killed. We are also very appreciative that members of the party were very open and willing to talk about this incident so that the rest of us can learn and be safer. Avalanches are stressful and confusing events. What is important in this scenario is that they exposed only one person at a time to the avalanche terrain. Despite the confusion, only one person was caught. Skier 2 was lucky to have avoided trauma. Even small avalanches moving slowly can cause serious trauma. Running into a tree a 20 mph (which is slow for an avalanche) can hurt.","Not an obvious place for an avalanche other than slope steepness. It was 36 degrees at the steepest and transitioned to 34 degrees and even lower on the far side of the crown. While this is definitely avalanche terrain, from a skier's perspective it is not very steep and seemingly benign.","A ridge of high pressure with clear skies and cold nights last week created small facets and surface hoar on the snow surface. Surface hoar just like frost on a car windshield except it is very fragile and can easily be destroyed by wind or sunshine. Winds began to increase on Wednesday night (1/18) and into Thursday morning (1/19), before diminishing midday on Thursday. At the Reynolds Peak wind station at 9400 ft, winds blew generally from the S and SSW 10-15 mph with only slightly stronger gusts. A the Parleys Summit weather station at 7000 ft, the strongest winds blew 10 mph gusting to 15 mph from a generally westerly direction. In contrast, winds at 11,000 ft in Little Cottonwood Canyon briefly blew 30 mph gusting to 50 mph from the S.

A weak storm system deposited 3-5"" in the Salt Lake mountains on Thursday. This snow capped and preserved this surface hoar layer on sheltered slopes where it wasn't destroyed by the wind. Snowfall since Thursday contained 1.8 inches of water at the Parleys Summit SNOTEL site at 7500 ft just north of Summit Park and I-80. Snowfall since Thursday contained 2.08 inches of water at the Spruces weather station at 7400 ft in Big Cottonwood Canyon. On the day of the accident, we found 18-26 inches of snow on top of the surface hoar layer which corresponds well to these water numbers.",20.0,2400.0,2400.0,7900.0,Start

I gained the ridgeline at the Little Superior Buttress, and decided to make my descent from just above it. As I removed my skins up on the ridge, I examined the slope below. The initial portion of the run dropped about 100 feet south east facing before opening up into a broader bowl above a rock band. My intention was to make my way skiers left over to the frequently skied fin that drops from just below the buttress.
 As I gained the more south facing open bowl above the rock band, I noticed a large number of roller balls and debris coming down from above. The next thing I knew, I was in the middle of a large wet slab avalanche. I suppose the release knocked me down, but at first it seemed like the slab was moving slowly. it started gaining speed as it carried me towards a funnel through the rock band. Unfortunately I was on my back with my legs and skis above me. I was unable to move to right myself and I realized I was going over the rock band, headfirst. The snow was so dense that I easily floated on top. It was like riding a 2 foot thick churning carpet of roller balls and slush. I believe it protected me from the rocks as I went backwards over the probably 20' rock band.
It certainly cushioned the blow as I came down on the slope below. Once over the rock band, the slide continued to gain speed. I had only one ski and one pole still with me, but I managed to get an edge into the sliding snow. I fought hard with the remaining pole and my free arm to get off of the slide to skier's left, just before it poured over the choke of a second and slightly taller rock band. For what seemed like a really long time, more than a minute for sure, the wet slide just kept pouring down from above and through the choke.
With the slide over, I waited for the adrenaline rush to subside somewhat and determined that I didn't have any serious injuries. I dialed 911 to alert Alta Central about the slide and that nobody had been buried in it. As I down climbed the rock band, kicking toeholds into the remaining snow, I punched through a few places to reveal a virtual waterfall- 3-4"" of running water below the snow surface.
Another 200 feet or so below, the slide had come to a stop in a broad tongue of debris 2-3 feet deep. My lost pole and ski were easily retrieved from their final resting places atop the debris pile. Making my way down to them, the bed surface was a moistened, but still bulletproof sun crust- completely scoured of the weekend's new snow. It wasn't until the low angle apron just above the road that I ever noted the snow surface to be getting damp and manky.

Forecaster Note: It's unknown if this was a wet loose sluff, or perhaps a slab. So we've classified it as a Storm Snow slide.",,,,1800.0,15000.0,10000.0,Start

We skied one run and on the second run the first skier dropped in and made 4 turns and just beyond the crest a 2- 2 1/2 foot fracture 80-100 feet wide broke loose. He rode it down almost buried (only head visable) and it came to a stop 100-120 yards down. He was buried up to waist and was able to dig out on own. 
Overcast, foggy, no wind around 30 degrees.

Snow was medium weight powder on top 2 feet and the slope angle was around 35-40 degree where the fracture occured. The debre at the bottom of slide was 3-4 feet deep. 
The slide let loose slowly--did no hear anything.
None
No new snow and it did not appear to be much wind loading.
I would pass by this line in the future.

Your Avalanche forcast for the day describes very much what happend in this incident. I can send photos later if you would like. Also the slide is visible from the top of the Milli lift.",,,24.0,960.0,,9700.0,Start

We realized the snow was denser than expected and slightly inverted on our hike in but we stayed out of the wind and never felt any slabby snow. This bowl is steep at the top, 38 plus degrees, then mellows out rapidly in the middle. We ascended in the steep trees on skiers right side, did a ski cut that only produced sluffing and skied the bowl with no obvious instabilities. We proceeded to hike up again but this time went up about 10 feet higher, still on the edge of the trees. My partner was about 10 feet in front of me and stomped out a flat spot to take his skins off, next thing we know the bowl is fracturing 50ft above us. My partner was on the edge of the slide and just got pushed 2 feet. I was in the middle, got pushed into a stand of trees and got buried to the top of my chest. I also heard and felt my hamstring pop. I was still in hiking mode with toes locked in and skins on with my legs all twisted up. It required my partner to dig me out and release my skis from my feet. A few minutes after I was out we heard a pop and the middle of the bowl pulled out remotely. The first slide was 100ft wide, 18 inches at the deepest point. The next slide extended the crown to 250ft and ran to where the slope flattened out. I doubt we would’ve triggered a slide if we would have stayed lower out of the windslab. The windslab wasn’t obvious but it only makes sense in retrospect. There’s a massive cornice at the top and while the wind wasn’t out of hand it was still loading the slope right below the cornice with denser snow. Sometimes the line between triggering a slide and not is thin but it sucks to be on the wrong side of that line. Just glad I had a good partner with me and can ski on one leg fairly efficiently. Mistakes were definitely made but we live and hopefully learn from them.""

About 2.7 miles from the parking lot they started to divert off the main trail and ascend toward a ridge. They were making switchbacks up a slope when they triggered an avalanche. The avalanche propagated about 300 feet above them. One skier was able to grab a tree and avoid taking the ride which the other skier did. He took about a 300 foot ride and was strained through some aspens and completely buried near the toe. His partner who did not go for a ride located him with an avalanche transceiver and dug him out from under about 4 feet of snow. He was uninjured and they were able to return to the parking lot on their own.,,,48.0,600.0,6000.0,7400.0,Start

Two men in their 30s left the closed Alta ski area with the intent to ride the well known terrain of Alta and Snowbird. Neither ski areas are open yet and have yet to conduct any avalanche control within their boundaries. We interviewed the victim's ski partner. To say he was shaken up is an understatement. 

While neither had any rescue gear or formal avalanche training, they were both expert skiers and knew the terrain well. They had not consulted the avalanche advisory that morning in which the danger was rated Considerable to High. They continued to Snowbird via Baldy and accessed the Peruvian Cirque to gain the Gad Valley. While ascending out of the Peruvian Cirque they remotely triggered a large avalanche that covered their tracks that they had just made. It's unclear whether they realized they had triggered this large avalanche. They gained the ridge and prepared to drop into Gad Valley.

With the partner watching, the victim dropped into the slope, immediately triggering the slide. He was carried approximately 800 feet through steep rocky terrain and reportedly went over a small cliff band and came to a stop only partially buried. The partner went down to help the victim and called for a rescue, alerting both the Snowbird Ski Patrol and Wasatch Backcountry Rescue, who subsequently accessed and evacuated the victim.

At the bottom of this report we have posted the comments submitted by the lead guide.",Much of the adjacent terrain that is less steep was covered in ski tracks.,"Periodic storms during October, November, and early December interspersed by long durations of high pressure allowed the snowpack to develop weak, faceted layers of sugary snow. Storms accompanied by west/northwest winds from Saturday 12/23 through Monday 12/25 deposited 2' of storm and wind-drifted snow in upper Little Cottonwood Canyon, overloading these buried weak layers.

It is likely the west/northwest winds on 12/22 and 12/23 created the 4"" 1F slab on top of the faceted layer where the failure occurred.

Avalanche activity on mid and upper elevation slopes facing north through east, and continued reports of collapsing and cracking, throughout the week prior to this incident indicated continued instability.

There are many reasons to know who you’re riding with, what avalanche gear they have and what and how much avalanche training they have taken. You always hear people say, that will never happen to me. Unfortunately, you never know. It’s a risk we take every day in the backcountry.

 

We were extremely lucky today. We happened to be in the wrong place. A slide was triggered and one of our friends was caught and carried. He fought to stay on top of the snow headed downhill head first. His sled was stopped by a big pine tree and buried pretty deep. He got separated from his sled and continued down to the next tree. This is where Curtis found him within a minute or so. His hand was out of the snow. Curtis started digging to clear his airways. Justin was talking, while Curtis worked to get him the rest of the way out. His adrenaline kicked in and was going as soon as Curtis got him out.


Did we make mistakes today? Maybe. But we also did everything we have been trained to do. We checked the UAC forecast, we had our gear and used our training to make it home safe.

The east facing slope south of Saint Charles Peak is committing because there is no good way to ride out the bottom, so you have to come back up the hill in order to exit the drainage. The party played around on adjacent slopes and two had successfully climbed back out of the 36 degree slope a few times. 

The slope had several tracks in it at the time of the avalanche. One rider climbed to the saddle on the top and watched, and a second was at the bottom also watching as the third attempted the climb. On the second attempt, the 47-year-old rider's sled did not have quite enough power to make the climb, and he turned near the top of the slope. The snow on the slope fractured even as the rider guided his sled in a rightward arc back down the hill. 

The avalanche caught rider and sled near the south flank and a large rock held up the sled for a bit while the rider was carried (he mentioned using swimming motions) to near the toe at the bottom of the avalanche, ending up about 150' below his sled, face-down and partially buried in the debris. The fourth rider was below on the slope and heading up when the slope fractured. He decided to keep his sled pointed up the hill and rode on top of the slab, the throttle pegged, track spinning like a treadmill as the slab ran underneath, leaving him safely on the bed surface. 

The other riders were able to get down to the lucky survivor and had him out of a face-down partial burial quite quickly. He was quickly spotted by his companions, and they had him out of the debris in ""really only a couple minutes."" Thankfully, now He is mainly only shaken, and recovering from minor injuries. The sled was damaged in the avalanche, but the party repaired it in the field the next day and rode it out of the hole. 

 ","This slope has a particularly notable history of avalanche accidents. It is the site of an epic January 11, 2014 rescue, where a rider was fully buried, suffered a double femur fracture, and had to be hauled up 1600' by rope. The rescue ended up going on well into the night, and involved about 50 rescuers from Cache, Franklin, and Bear Lake Counties. Read Report

The same slope was the site of a tragic fatality on February 19, 2000. Read Report 

The avalanche occurred on a mostly east facing slope and started at around 9200' in elevation. The toe of the avalanche was at around 8700'. The slope measures only about 36 degrees in steepness in the steepest area, and I measured the Alpha angle of this avalanche at 25 degrees.",,24.0,5400.0,6000.0,9200.0,End

Turns out that with current snowpack conditions, the steeper section at the top of rib was able to slide, even though the rest of the rib didn't. The slide was triggered at the steep break over at the top of the rib, and the portion that the skier was caught in was about 60' wide and 2 feet deep. However, the slide was able to propagate to skiers left, into part of an adjacent gully, where it was closer to 90 feet wide, and entrained much more snow.

Here is a post on the TGR forum by the victim, which I reprint with permission after talking to him on the phone today.
skibum is most likely referring to me... skied supe with telethor, tt's cousin and whapworth this morning, what an amazing run that is. great snow, noticed some debris in the usual spots but nothing too scary. left those guys at the bottom to go ski the bird with a buddy, and had a great day there too. about 2-3pm, i decided to ski out to white pine with a couple guys, one happened to be a coach for the SB freeski team and longtime ripper so i was confident following his lead, especially after our amazing run down sketchier SE superior. we skied to the very top of scotty's, scoped a little, and he dropped first, noticing sloughing but nothing much. since it was N facing and i was thinking it had been pretty cold with inconsistent sun all day, wet slabs were the last thing in my mind, and breaking off a deep slab was also not really something i was worried about. i dropped second in our party of three. made 2-3 turns on the spine i dropped on, and then got the feeling something wasn't right. figured some slough was chasing me, tried to stay high on the shoulder, but a BIG slab had ripped out above and around me. the rest is a blur, but i got taken in the 500-1000 foot range down the slope, maybe 2-300 vert. couldn't get my avalung in, as i think my shoulders had already popped from swimming when i went for it, my head went under a few times, and i came very close to numerous large trees. ended up in the open area underneath, with a bit of snow over my legs (whice were above my head), but head and most of body up. both skis/poles were apparently gone (partner found 2 skis 1 pole), and my shoulders were both completely dislocated, but i was up and OK. later on in the clinic (I somehow managed to avoid a chopper ride and skied the final ~1500 vert out, hunched over and in some serious pain) i heard it was 3-4 feet at the crown, and 200 feet wide. no idea how deep the debris was, though it didn't seem very deep where i ended up, but with the amount of snow that came down i am sure it could have buried me (my partner was luckily around 100 feet away from my resting place). it was by far the scariest moment of my entire life, and by sheer luck, and maybe a bit of help from the swimming, i made it, but it could have very easily turned out differently had i smashed one of the large trees or ended up in a different spot in the debris. i don't know if it was stupidity in not recognizing the significant warming from morning to afternoon, or an anomaly that i happened to strike in just the right place, but regardless i am thankful to be alive and happy no one else was involved. i plan on calling the UAC tomorrow and giving them my full account of what happened (i got home from the OR, where they had to completely get me under to get my L shoulder back in, around midnight tonight), and am very interested to read the full report. i learned a sobering lesson the hard way, but am lucky to live to ski another day, though i have a feeling it is going to take awhile for me to feel comfortable beyond the boundaries again. be careful out there guys, i am surprised and grateful that after my ride on a day when people were getting after much bigger stuff then scotty's, no one else was apparently injured or worse.",,,20.0,600.0,3600.0,,Start

They were part of a group of 8 containing 3 guides and 5 clients who ascended Gobbler's ridge via Baker pass. They observed a size 2.5 (destructive scale) natural avalanche from the previous day on an east facing slope on Mt. Raymond but no cracking, collapsing or other signs of instability on the day of the accident.

Bradley and one client descended a south facing avalanche path west of and adjacent to the path of the fatal avalanche. After this run the client left the area because he had a meeting in town at 12:30 p.m. They skied the slope without incident while the rest of the group skied a north westerly facing, treed slope known as the “Benign Line.”

After the first run Bradley re-ascended the ridge and approached the top of the run called Whitesnake. He was joined by three others, one of whom was Douglas Green, and an apprentice guide. The third guide and one other client skied the “Benign Line” again.

Bradley dropped into the Whitesnake path, made a few ski cuts, and stopped 300' downhill at an island of safety on skier’s right about a foot above and to the side of where the avalanche released (see photo). He directed Green to ski to him. The apprentice guide and the other two clients remained at the top of the run. After regrouping, Bradley began skiing again and directed Green to remain where they had stopped. While skiing the next section, the guide felt the slope collapse (which is the weak layer failing just before the avalanche releases). At the same time he noticed Green had started skiing as well. The apprentice guide and the other two clients remained at the top of the run.

Bradley was caught in the avalanche but continued moving right. He impacted a tree and was pushed upward by the avalanche but not carried downhill. He was partially buried and sustained minor injuries. Green was carried downhill and fully buried. He inflated his avalanche air-bag backpack at some point during the avalanche.

After extricating himself from avalanche debris, Bradley skied down the scoured avalanche path and around an exposed rock band where he triggered a small avalanche. He started a beacon search at the edge of the avalanche debris. After covering several hundred yards of debris, he acquired the Green’s signal. His beacon indicated a distance of 77 meters. At the burial location the smallest distance displayed by his beacon was 0.9 meters. He pinpointed Green’s exact location with an avalanche probe.

Green was fully buried on his side with his head approximately 3 feet deep and his body approximately 4-5 feet. His avalanche airbag was inflated. Maximum debris depth was 15 feet. Bradley dug him out of the debris and began CPR. He could not find a pulse. The apprentice guide and two other skiers arrived about a minute after Bradley began digging. They assisted in the exhausting work of digging Green out of the debris. The avalanche was reported at 14:30 to Alta Central Dispatch by the third guide. A medical helicopter landed and evacuated both the Bradley and Green to a hospital in Salt Lake City where Green was pronounced deceased.

The enormous debris pile snapped aspen trees and covered the terrain trap gully below the avalanche path for hundreds of yards. There was no stauchwall or lower boundary of the avalanche because the slab covering the entire slope released, creating an enormous amount of avalanche debris. The avalanche - estimated at 1-2' deep and 600' wide, pulled down every bit of snow between the starting zone near the ridge at 10,000' and well into the gulley at 9000'. The alpha angle, the angle from the toe of the debris to the crown, was 22 degrees.

The Utah Avalanche Center rated the avalanche danger in this terrain as Considerable and had issued an Avalanche Warning on January 21, 2016. See danger rose and bottom line below from that day’s advisory.



“There [are] many weak layers and issues that will cause avalanches today. All the red flags are present. Widespread recent avalanche activity both natural and human triggered, recent snow and strong winds, widespread faceted layers in the snowpack, and today will have strong sunshine and temperatures possibly going above freezing. All these factors combine to make very dangerous avalanche conditions and a HIGH avalanche danger.”

The full advisory from that day can be found at:

https://utahavalanchecenter.org/advisory/salt-lake/01/21/2016

 ","The Whitesnake avalanche path just below the west summit of Gobbler's Knob at 10,246' has a steep starting zone that funnels into a narrow, rocky gully. The starting zone aspects ran from 107 degrees ESE to 215 degrees SSW. The upper starting zone was cross-loaded from strong west to northwest winds in the late evening of January 19 into January 20. Slope angles across the crown were not measured as conditions remained too hazardous to access the fracture line, though the starting zone is estimated at 35-37 degrees. Two adjacent slopes avalanched naturally several days later on January 24 and January 27.","The weather has been complex this winter. November’s snow was followed by a long, dry spell with only small, intermittent snow storms through early December. Periodic cold temperatures and clear skies faceted the shallow snowpack on shady slopes during this time. A series of storms between December 12th and 25th added several feet of snow to the snow pack and led to a major avalanche cycle.

Weather events became even more complex in January. The New Year was ushered in with a strong southeasterly wind event that scoured and loaded unusual aspects, producing another avalanche cycle. This was followed by small, almost daily storms between January 3rd and 8th. A dry spell between January 9th and 13th, with warm sunny days and clear cold nights, developed near surface facets on shady slopes and created ice crusts on top of faceted snow on solar aspects.

Between January 14th and 20th, snow fell six out of seven days, culminating on January 20th with strong southwest to northwesterly winds, dense heavy snow and an active avalanche cycle. Snow totals from Big Cottonwood and the Park City side ranged from 7” to 11"" on the 20th, with storm water equivalents of .65"" to 1.04"". The Mill D North SNOTEL site had similar SWE numbers.

January 21st had sunny skies and temperatures ranging from near 10 degrees F into the low 20s.",18.0,7200.0,15000.0,10000.0,Start

This is information is from talking with the Canyons ski patrollers who responded to the accident and a visit to the site by UAC forecasters Evelyn Lees and Brett Kobernik. More details may be added later if it is possible to interview the survivor.

The accident occurred in Dutch Draw, a backcountry area south of the Canyons Resort.

Timothy and his partner were on snowboards. They left through the well marked boundary gate at the top of 9990 Lift and traversed south It is believed both the victim and his partner descended about 150 or 200’ below the ridgeline and stopped near the cliffs. Then Timothy descended the next section first, triggered a slab avalanche. He was caught, carried and buried. Neither he nor his partner were wearing a beacon or had rescue gear.

Rescue: Timothy’s partner immediately headed down to the debris and started searching. As other backcountry travelers in adjacent area came into view, he called out for help, and a total of 8 people arrived. One was sent for help. The other 7 people searched the debris. None of the parties were equipped with beacons or rescue gear. Some skiers popped the baskets off their poles and probed. One struck the victim’s snowboard and they started digging just as 2 Canyons ski patrollers arrived on the scene. Timothy was dug out, and a ski patroller and Timothy’s partner started CPR. They transported the victim to a nearby flat area where a medical helicopter could land and transport the victim to the hospital. The victim was buried about 40 minutes. It is unknown if he died from trauma or asphyxiation.

The victim was carried about 600 vertical feet, strained through small trees, and buried near the toe of the slide. He buried head first downhill, face down, with his head approximately 3 feet below the snow surface in debris that was about 6 to 8 feet deep. The snowboard was broken in half, but held together by some of the material. 

 

email from Jay Torgersen, Flight Paramedic, AirMed

I was on the AirMed team that responded to the Canyons and worked with their Patrol on the side-country accident/fatality yesterday. Our team was made up of Casey Thompson-RN, Troy Stanton-Pilot and myself. Just wanted to pass on to your investigation team what a fantastic job the Canyon’s Patrol did coordinating the initial rescue effort. It was a difficult and potentially dangerous situation that they handled extremely well. It was evident that safety was their number one priority, not just for their own personnel but for those of us called in to assist. They also had to consider the safety of bystanders and the victim’s party who were attempting a partner rescue. There were several variables to consider in the cost versus benefit analysis faced by those running the incident. Having experienced and organized incident commanders with well thought out strategic plans and back-ups allowed the operation to unfold without further incident or harm to all involved. Without addressing the victims own personal preparedness, I don’t think there was anything that could have been done that would have changed the ultimate outcome. The Canyon’s Patrol and the Summit County SO team should be commended for outstanding work performed in a stressful, challenging and extremely difficult environment. Take care and be safe!

Our group was in Upper Days. I dropped in first on an east facing slope and made 3 turns and I felt the snow collapse and crack off to my right above me and it had cracked below me and to my left. I pulled my airbag and was carried about 800-1000ft. I was only partially buried to my waist due to my airbag and didn't sustain any injuries from being carried. 

 

This avalanche started on the edge of Upper days and propagated through to Two Dogs. The crowns were between 18"" and over 4' in some areas between 800-1,000ft wide. The slides ran between 1,000-1,500 ft.
