No tracks entering the slope.  Potentially a remote trigger yesterday (Dec 1st) by one of the many passing riders on their way to the summit.  Although this avalanche location is the obvious and frequent starting zone for the area, it is important to note that the snowpack is still very shallow in these lower elevation areas, with plenty of nasty logs and rocks to get hung up on.

 

Below the ridge line and within wind-sheltered trees, the new snow is not propagating much farther than the length of the ski.  On the slopes we skied today it was possible to produce ski-width slabs on small test slopes but nothing more.

It was difficult to determine a trigger, however there were snowmobile tracks on the ridgetop adjacent to the slide. The crown spanned aspects from east- northeast and there was some variability in the hardness of the wind slab over the weak layer throughout the crown face. 

 

The weak layer was approximately 80cm off of the ground and consisted of a very thin melt freeze crust with small grained facets above and below.  There were sections of the bed surface that were over 1 meter deep. What this tells us is that the weak layer is elevated off of the ground.  What this means for us as backcountry travelers is that the potential for much larger avalanches could be more prevalent this season.

 

This avalanche was reported late in the day on Saturday December 3, 2022. DPS did a fly by and worked with Park City Patrol to determine that there was no one involved. This avalanche occurred in closed terrain within the Park City Ski Area Boundary and resembles backcountry terrain in similar areas.

This was on a ridge to the NW of the weather station. 

 

My plan was to ski the ridge down into trees and to cut the slope on my way over. I have seen this slope release multiple times. It seems to have the right combination of convex roll leading into a steeper section (35-38 degrees) along with terrain driven winds that must deposit close to the loading point on the convexity. Its a short shot, but can be dangerous as it drains into some trees. 

 

It was the end of my day, and I made a tired and lazy decision that I was high enough up on the ridge to cut the slope. 

 

The slope broke above me at the new snow old surface interface, then stepped down about 8-6"" onto facets above what I believe is the old dry spell layer. 

 

I was able to carry momentum and ski off to the north. 

 

There was a small amount of hangfire left at the crown slope convexity, but not enough to worry me, so I went back to take a look and investigate the snow layering.

7200.0,24.0,3000,"We observed significant cracking and collapsing on our ascent. We took a lower angled but brushy approach. We skied a couple of slopes below 30 degrees. Rather than climb back up to exit lower angle slopes we mistakenly decided to ski a steeper slope that we had skied several times this season. The first skier skied 6-8 turns to an island of safety and then the second skier joined the first. The third skier came down from above us to skiers left and skied the slope without incident to a lower ridge which is usually safe. The second skier then followed him down. On his third turn the slope fractured 100' above him and began to move. The first skier yelled avalanche and instructed the second skier to go left. At the same time the slope to the right fractured and slid to the ground. Another slope to our left also released and slid about the same time.

The second skier was knocked down and I lost sight of him in a cloud of snow as he was carried downhill. I followed him visually down the slope from where I lost sight of him. I yelled to our other partner that I couldn't see him hoping he had a visual. Then I spotted him a couple of hundred feet below me, on a ledge near the left edge of the debris pile, as the snow stopped moving. He lost both skis and broke both safety straps. He took a beating as he was carried through maple and scrub oak. He was pinned to the ground by dense snow around his pack unable to move until he unbuckled his pack. He stood up and found one ski nearby and I located the other ski above him in some scrub oak.

He described being caught and carried, tumbling in the snow seeing nothing but white until he came to a stop on the surface. He was pummeled by snow and branches as he was carried down the slope. No major injuries occurred but he will be bruised and pulled a hamstring. He thought he was taking his last breath and so did I. It's not a good feeling. We were lucky he was ok and able to ski out. The ridge we skied out was noted to crack more than 20 times on our exit but wasn't steep enough to slide.

What did we do wrong? We didn't pay attention to the obvious and significant cracking and collapsing as we skinned up. This was at the same elevation as the avalanche we triggered.  We chose an exit from the mountain that was too steep because we didn't want to hike up to a lower angle exit. We were lulled to sleep by good skiing earlier in the day. We didn't do a proper ski cut before skiing this slope. We didn't fully understand the effects that 4 inches of rain had on the snow pack. We thought the rain would stabilize the snow pack but it completely saturated the snow to the ground making it weaker. We didn't register or heed advice from UAC forecast.

What did we do right? We reviewed the UAC forecast before our tour. We skied one at a time utilizing islands of safety above and below the slope that avalanched. We were equipped with beacons, probes and shovels and knew how to use this gear. We practice with our beacons, probes and shovels.  We reported this slide so others can learn from our mistakes. It's embarrassing to admit we screwed up.

In summary we messed up and were very lucky that things didn't turn out worse.

*Forecaster note: Thank you for the write up and sharing the information -

 

Dropped into conehead for my third run of the morning, 2nd on conehead and the 4th set of tracks on the slope. On my 3rd or 4th turn I saw the slope start to break up and immediately cut hard right. This resulted in being taken off my feet and being carried approximately 30-40 yards. I dropped a pole and went to airbag handle but gave one hard stomp with my downhill ski and got lucky. It caught, put me back on my feet and allowed me to ski out of the slide to skiers right.



Being able to ski out of this slide was beyond lucky and should not have happened. This was a huge wake up call on being too comfortable with familiar terrain and not giving the heavy storm load the full respect it deserves.

 

best guess the crown was approximately 18-24"" deep.

Starting on the looker's left side of the slide it was about 3.5' deep and got shallower the further looker's right it went down to about 1'. In some places it went to the ground and in other it looked like it was within the old snow. Not crazy huge, but definely enough to bury a person especially considering it dumped right into the gully. Quite a few ski tracks around it.

Today we dropped into Greaseball Couloir just north of the summit of Kessler Peak with the plan to ride out Argenta. On our way up, we dug a snowpit to test stability and found no deep instabilities in the snow structure. As we approached the ridge of Kessler we noticed a lot of wind coming over the ridge and depositing on the North face. We did some stability stomps and were unable to get anything to propagate or observe any shooting cracks. As we traversed from the summit of Kessler to the entrance of the line, we started noticing cross loading beneath the top of the couloir which was causing some strange wind pockets and small cornices. To test the stability of the cross loaded surface, I stood back and stomped at the base of a cornice about the size of a small fridge. The cornice broke and dropped onto the slope without causing any propagation on the slope below. Outside the cross loading, the majority of the wind gusts were coming up the couloir and depositing snow onto the East Face of Kessler. Which made us believe that there likely wasn't any widespread wind loading issues in the couloir proper.
 

I descended first and dropped into the hanging bowl, after making a heel side turn, an isolated wind slab broke loose below and above me which knocked me off my feet and took me for a ride. I was able to keep the majority of my body above the snow and was able to radio my partner that I was sliding with the debris. I made swimming motions with my arms and kicked my board to help keep me on top. After about 300 feet, I was able to slow down and stop, while the rest of the debris released below me. After regrouping, we descended the debris. The slope slid about 1,300 feet. 
 

Mistakes / Learnings: 



-Respect the wind. Even a small ""manageable"" wind pocket can break and carry you a long way in steep terrain with long runouts. 



-Cross loading is serious. I had read the avy forecast and knew that wind was a problem, but I did not anticipate cross loading to be as obvious as a problem, as this is less common in the Wasatch. Lesson learned.



-Make a ski cut. I think I could have mitigated some hazard had I made a ski cut before dropping onto the hanging snow field.

The slope was small so it ended only 100' below in the lower angle treed slope but piled up quite deep. The slope angle directly below the cornice was steep at 39-40 deg. for a short distance. I think it needed this pitch as lower angle slopes were less sensitive and more stubborn. The weak layer was a density inversion at the old snow interface about 30-40cm down.

The rocks were about 35 feet above us and the slope was 20 feet wide.  After discussing options/precautions, skier 2 (submitter) stayed back in a safe spot while skier 1 stepped out into the slope. Skier 1's steps quickly triggered a slide in the new snow layer--roughly 6"" on average and starting all the way from the rocks above. Skier 1 stayed in place on their feet during the slide then continued across to sub 30 degree terrain just beyond the slope. 

 

The slide was 20 feet wide and went 200+ feet downhill. At it's deepest, the new snow layer there was 8"" but was only 3"" up at the rocks. The slope where skier 1 triggered it from was 39 degrees. At it's steepest by the rocks above, we would estimate the slope was nearly 45 degrees. 

 

Overall the slide was small and the skier had no trouble standing in place while it happened. No movement at all in the 33 degree and 28 degree terrain over ridges on either side. However, we both immeadiately recognized that in larger terrain, the same situation could have been much worse. We double checked our plan and adjusted for extra caution.

18000.0,48.0,4800,"This avalanche ran during a storm cycle that ultimately produced 32"" of snow at 3.6"" SWE. It was accompanied by strong SW winds. Heavy snow around New Year's produced many large avalanches on the same PWL. Since then the snowpack has gained considerable strength and in most areas the snowpack is very deep - up to 200 cms or more. This avalanche failed in a shallower snowpack area, on a slope with a steep convexity that is subject to heavy wind loading. A stability test performed on a nearby slope produced no results. It is our opinion that this avalanche is somewhat anomalous with a perfect storm of conditions, and that avalanches like this are unlikely to be triggered by humans.

I did find the occasional more reactive 1F patch of snow.

 

I was winding my way up the ridge, regularly changing directions to manage slope angle, cornice formation, firmer snow, and blustery wind. I stopped in a flat-ish spot just uphill of a tree to change directions and move left around the windward side of the cornice. 

 

I stomped a bit to pack the snow in and enable me to turn when the avalanche released. The fracture sheared nearly vertically and dropped the bulk of the cornice (which was not overhung). It also propagated along the ridgeline about 75 feet. Below the cornice was a flat moment in the snow, which retained the pictured hang fire. The convex roll just below this fractured and released a slab about 30ft across by 20ft of vert that ran downslope at least 50ft into the trees.

The angle kicks up at the very top and realizing this I made a kick turn to bail to the windward side - as I was approaching the crest, I was conscience of the fact that my weight would likely set off a wind slab and on literally my last step to the ridge it did just that - the snow dropped Out from under my feet and I awkwardly rode the slab (heel lifters up) roughly 20 ft down to where the angle mellows out and came to a halt standing up. Looking back up, it looked like the crown was about a foot at its deepest and 25-30' wide. In hindsight, ski crampons and sticking to the windward side would have been the safer option and had the terrain below/ adjacent been steeper and more connected, I wouldn't have chosen this route up at all.

Party of 3 climbed to Cardiff Pass then west toward Superior. Experienced moderate wind and a few stronger gusts - consistent with the last few days' forecasts. Stopped to transition just short of Little Superior intending to ride the higher ground on SE aspect. First rider began to traverse right to reach that point and triggered the slab within seconds. Party member above reports feeling a collapse underfoot - it's possible the trigger was from above. Rider attempted to move right and didn't make much progress before falling into seated position and ""swimming"" to stay on top. Rider was carried about 60 feet before coming to a stop without burial. The slide ran at least 800? vertical feet down the gully towards Two Trees - didn't get a great look at the full path on the exit. Party continued right and descended ridges.

 
In hindsight:

- We did not respect the forecast in our terrain choice. The group was familiar with recent forecasts and discussed impact of the wind multiple times but opted to continue with original objective after *very* casual observations along the skin track didn't expose activity.

- A few tens of yards of climbing could have made the difference in terrain. Because we stopped short it was necessary to make a small traverse to the safer high ground, but doing so meant crossing above an obvious trap. Transitioning a bit further ahead would have kept us out of the gully and on safer terrain from the start.

- The transition had thin cover in places and exposed rocks. Could have noted the weak point and taken it into account.

 

Close call and humbling for sure.

Breaking about 18"" deep and 100' wide, the slide failed on a layer of weak, sugary, near surface facets formed on 1/23 and buried during last weeks storms.

Skier 1 skied far right on the shoulder, Skier two skied left of that track closer to the bowl, and skier three skied even further left. Skier three triggered the avalanche and was able to self arrest/ski off the slab. We re-grouped on the lower shoulder and although we were mostly confident nobody was in the basin where the avalanche ran into, out of an abundance of caution we sent one skier down to perform a transceiver search.

 

With two of us remaining on the shoulder to watch for any remaining hangfire from above, skier 2 skied onto the bed surface just uphill of the skiers right flank and performed a tranceiver signal search of the debris with no results or signal found. No tracks were noted in the area and we were now confident that nobody was buried in the avalanche. At this point we called Alta Ski Patrol to notify them of the avalanche and inform them that we had performed a transceiver search with no results. The two skiers on the shoulder then followed skier 2's tracks onto the bed surface to perform a crown profile while skier 2 transitioned and skinned back up the bed surface to the rest of the party.

 

We then skied back into the ski area via lower Patsy Marley, coming across another smaller avalanche which ASP was already aware of, and we performed a signal search with patrol there as well.  Overall, a more sensitive snowpack than we anticipated out there today, this one caught us off guard and we're lucky we didn't have a more serious involvement.

I hiked up to the ridge with my dog, strapped on my board, and called my wife to have her record me riding down the slope.  As I started riding down, I hooted and hollered a little.  I heard a soft sound almost like the rustling of leaves, and looked to my left to see a large area of snow sliding down the slope.  It almost looked like molten lava flowing down the mountainside.  Once I realized what was happening, I looked above me and around me - thankfully nothing above me was sliding.  Once the avalanche stopped, I called my dog and rode down to the bottom.  I felt very lucky that I chose to ride just 100 or so feet to the east of where the slide occurred, and not right on it.  I was also glad that the avalanche did not hit my neighbors houses.

Adding this text-only observation a day late because in hindsight it seems like the avalanche could have failed in a radiation-recrystalization or other NSF/crust combo that developed on 1/26. Initially we assumed it failed in pooled graupel, but the steep, planar slope seems more likely to bear some RR etc. than pooled graupel. No pics and no actual forensics because the light was bad and we were above the crown; so it's really just a hunch. But it seems like in some places there's complexity in the upper snowpack right now that folks (like me) don't always factor in, or dig down to evaluate, when they're mostly thinking about windslabs.

3600.0,24.0,1200,"SS-AS-D1-R1. While skinning up towards Pole-line/Cardiff pass, we noticed a small avalanche on the southwest side of the Flagstaff shoulder with one ski track entering the crown, and we were unable to see any ski tracks exiting the debris or slope. We shifted directions towards the avalanche, and once at the bottom still could not see any tracks exiting. Despite the small size of the avalanche, we were concerned about a potential hangup in the trees within the path for the involved party. We decided to send two from our group of 5 up to perform a transceiver signal search because it appeared that the individual may have been traveling alone. The remaining group members stayed in the flats, keeping eyes on the hanging snow above, and called Alta Central to inform them of the situation, so Alta Ski Patrol could standby if the signal search yielded results. We turned our beacons to search at the toe of the debris, and continued to switchback up the slope, spacing out ~50 feet. The debris in the open snow, for the most part, was not deep enough to bury a human. On the trees there was debris piled up to 7 feet deep.

 

After we reached the stauchwall(roughly) we were finally able to see a ski track exiting to the skier's right, through the trees, traversing far out on the slope away from the avalanche. Given the traversing nature of the track, it was almost impossible to see from a downhill angle. At this point, we put our transceivers back into send, and communicated the info back down to the rest of our party below so they could communicate back to Alta Central. Out of an abundance of caution, we sent one skier up to the uppermost trees, the last point where anyone involved in the avalanche could have been pinned. It seemed that the involved party had indeed arrested, pinned, or otherwise stopped against these trees, and then skied out. Hard to tell exactly, but this is my best guess. From here I traversed over to the crown to perform a quick profile, then skied back down to the rest of the group. Picture of the trees from uphill included below.

A UAC forecaster visited this slide on Wed, Feb 1st - additional notes from the UAC: 
The avalanche failed on a S/SE facing aspect at 9400'. This slide failed as a slab of wind drifted snow on a layer of small grain facets above a solar crust. The slab was between 10-20"" deep. While it is hard to tell if it failed on small grain facets that were formed by radiation recrystallization, the setup seems. Small grain facets exist below the crust as well. Radiation recrystallization was occurring on the surface above the crown. 

Notes from Tim: 
This morning before work I got in a quick Beartrap Aspens lap. From the ridge summit of Aspens, around 8800 feet, I noticed a large southeast-facing slide off of the West Willow Ridgeline into Mule Hollow. I've skied that aspect and area several times this year, but in less sensitive snowpack conditions, and was personally surprised to see a slide there, especially since the WBSkiing app has this area labeled white, aka not steep enough to slide. It's a good lesson to use the app only as general guideline when observing slope aspects and steepness. 

If I had to guess, I'd say the slide is a few hundred feet long and wide, and several feet deep. Based on where I was standing on the lower ridge summit below, I'd guess the cause was natural due to heavy wind loading from the most recent storm, and that this slide probably happened over the weekend. I did not notice any tracks going in, or near, the slide path, so I did not feel it was necessary to ski into Mule Hollow and do a proper beacon search. If I had seen tracks going into the slide, I probably would have done so. 
 

Looking forward to the snowpack healing up again to sneak in some bigger lines. Stay safe people.

Other than the several day old naturals avalanches, we were not able to get anything to slide today.  There was plenty of wind loading from this week and we found significant sastrugi along all the ridge lines (see pic 2).  Riding was not stellar at upper elevations due to all the wind affected zones.  Even where the snow looked good, there were stout wind drifts in unexpected locations.

2393.083129001348,36.0,540,"Started the tour today under cloudy skies that soon turned to heavy snowfall of approximately 1 inch per hour. Had a route planned to climb and to ski what we believed to be safe and protected from the recent winds. We had discussed the possible danger, and wind slabs were the top of the list to look out for. The planned climbing route is one I had used a few times in years past, but had most often used as a descent route. As I was climbing I noticed the wind cross loading slopes well above us, and we discussed the route that we planned to ski as it may have been in that zone. But we did not discuss the climbing route as we were not seeing much wind transport in that area. 

 

The initial ascent route was in a tight creek bottom. Anything with some south aspect had rollerballed and had a stout crust from the day before. Just a few feet away north facing felt soft, with a slight density inversion 6-8"" down. The skin track varied from crust stout enough to not break through, up to 8 inches of ski penetration. The light was very flat, and it was difficult to tell uphill from down in many places and slope steepness was hard to judge. This led to the mistake of being on this slope. 

 

From looking at the map earlier in the tour, I had planned to be up out of the creek bottom and onto a north facing bench sooner, But with very few visual clues and the intense snowfall rate, I had missed this turn. As we were skinning up the drainage, I noticed the slope get steeper but struggled to plan the track due to the flat light. I could see some brush ahead and misestimated the slope angle between myself and the brush. As I climbed towards it, it became too steep to skin that direction so I stopped to kick turn to my right. As I completed my kick turn I heard a loud crack and the slope started to move. 

 

As I had already changed direction my ski started to turn downhill and I was able to stay *mostly* on top of the debris. My partner, who was still facing uphill as the slide started, was sucked backwards, skis pulling under. I yelled for him to swim right as I was getting ready to go over the top of him. Luckily, the slope angle had gently backed off and the slide started to slow. When the snow stopped moving, I was able to take off skis and stand up. My partner was partially buried, waist deep with his head facing uphill, but downhill from his skis. His skis were under enough snow that I had to dig them out to release his bindings. 

 

The maximum crown depth was three feet, and averaged around 18 inches. Crown was 45-50 feet wide and total slide distance from crown to toe was about 60 feet. The wind slab was very cohesive and stayed in large blocks through the avalanche. It entrained a shocking amount of snow for the size. The crown was on a slope angle of 35 degrees, and broke about 5 feet above us, right at a convex roll. The angle of the slope at the toe was 20 degrees. 

 

We were very lucky that this happened on a slope with overall convexity with the slope angle backing off gently. Many places in the creek bottom we we're traveling through had sharp concave sections that could easily have been terrain traps. I am disappointed that I underestimated the amount of snow that had been loading in this zone over the previous days. Being fairly low elevation and in a tight drainage I mistakenly thought that the area hadn't seen much wind. I am also disappointed that I failed to recognize the windslab, and mistook it for a supportable crust. I don't think I had on my ""avalanche eyes"" at this point due to complacency and ease of travel. Had I been paying better attention to the route, and doing small checks of the snow along the way, I may have seen earlier signs of slab. One pole was lost, overall a very cheap lesson.

7200.0,10.0,960,"As my screen door whipped open this morning bending the closure mechanism I was reminded that ""Nothing good comes from an east wind"" - that was either Shakespeare, or UAC's Kowboy, but whoever it was, was right!  Last night/today's wind was cold, pernicious, and long lasting ('til about 3pm) and seemed to be working its way even into sheltered areas.  Despite the fact that there wasn't much new snow and it came in light, the wind whipped it into pretty good cake that made for surprisingly challenging trail breaking  - time and again  -and created shallow slabs (up to maybe 4"" thick).  I transitioned my mindset over the last week or so from cavalier to somewhat cautious today, because as Drew pointed out in his forecast this morning, things were weird/unusual, and that was borne out as I climbed and the snow got deeper, and thicker. 

I skied some steepish lines in pretty deep/thick trees, and then on my exit on a pretty open, west/NW facing slope saw that there appeared to be a decent-sized slide that I guessed had been triggered earlier in the day by skiers, since it wasn't fully blown-over with new snow and there were a good handful of tracks nearby.  With a decent slope on the other side there must have been some good opportunity for snow transport up and over the ridge, and the strength/swirliness of the wind probably created a slab on the lee side slope, which is probably not much of a frequent flier because it's normally fronting the typical prevailing winds; it's understandable that this could be misread today.  There wasn't a distinct crown so it was shallow, the debris wasn't deep, and there were no obstacles in the way, but it ran a long way and was a bit sobering nonetheless.  This will probably heal fairly quickly, but exposed zones could still be pretty triggery on Thursday, though for sure some exposed terrain may have snow windblasted into place....but on which aspects?  The wind seemed to be coming from every which way as it started to fade out in the afternoon.

2400.0,12.0,360,"Saw this avalanche near the mouth of Emigration Canyon on a northwest aspect behind some of the Condo Towers. I've never seen a slide path in the canyon before in the 5 years I've lived in it. Snow depth is around 2-3 feet on those slopes and it looks to have broke near the ground, probably 18"" crown or so with a 100+ foot width. The slope angle is 40+ degrees on these slopes, so a very steep angle. 

 

This is notable because during the winters this area is an active one for bow hunters, I've regularly seen them on these aspects hiking in the snow. The runout was around 500 feet through a few terrain traps. There's still a lot of snow on the northerly aspects below 6k feet, hikers and hunters need to be aware. Unclear what triggered this slide, possibly a large animal, we have a few herd of deer around. 

 

 

Forecaster Notes:  Thank you for the report- we have seen a few other animal triggered (?) slides in the foothills this winter (Big Cottonwood, Ogden). We went to look at this avalanche on February 20th. It stood out as unique and we wanted to see what the lower elevation snowpack looked like prior to the next storm.  This avalanche was most likely triggered by a deer on a layer of rounding facets above a melt freeze crust. It averaged 12"" deep, 18"" at the deepest on a 35 degree slope. The avalanche was 30' wide and between the 2 slides ran about 300' down the slope. It was difficult to see the debris as it dispersed into the trees.  I believe this was from an easterly canyon wind that cross loaded the slope. We did not go to the crown face as there were  cracks above the crown and not worth the risk.

We (party of 4) were climbing to gain the ridge between Yellow Jacket Trees and Cabin Run and ended up higher than we intended and missed the safer entrance to the ridge. None of us had done this approach before. We could see skyline through the trees and decided that two of our party would wait a safe distance back in the trees while two of us checked out the entrance onto the ridge. The two that continued realized that we were high as soon as we popped out of the trees and briefly talked about options, including going back down into the trees and retreating lower. However, the top of the ridge was one good kick turn away and we got sucked into that ""it’s so close” trap.

As my partner took some steps toward the top of the ridge I actually backed away even further and started getting pretty nervous but only said, “be careful, that looks wind loaded.” My partner was focused on a cornice on his left until he said, “oh, this is where the wind is dropping all the snow”. I had turned around and yelled to our other members to “not come up here”. I had decided we really should retreat, but I was too late and my partner yelled “slide”, and I turned back and saw the wind slab below the ridge break all around him. I tried to ski out to the side as I was on the very edge of where it propagated, but it hit me almost immediately. It broke probably 25’ wide and ran 50-60’; enough to take both of us for a short ride. My partner stopped at a tree probably 20’ down and I stopped at a tree 30’ down.

No burial, and no injuries besides a bruise. We did lose some poles. Once we determined everyone was ok we retreated and had a good debriefing and discussion of the traps we fell into.

Things we did right were space our party out as we became unsure of the route and terrain.

Things we did wrong were not turn around when we realized we had not approached the ridge the way we had intended. We knew we were in the wrong place, but got sucked into the feeling that it was just “right there”. The cornice drew our awareness away from the lower soft wind slab deposited below the ridge. Also, things can happen so quickly. Decisions can be made without fully understanding you are making them. Our group had a good dynamic and good communication generally, but in this moment we just didn’t take enough time. By the time I had processed my discomfort with the danger of continuing onto the ridge, it was too late. I needed to speak up immediately and more clearly. We should have returned and told the other two of our party the situation. I’m certain that would have changed our forward momentum and given us the time to make a better decision. We had been in pretty benign terrain all day, and had intended to keep it that way, but it only took 30 seconds for that to get away from us.

The avalanche broke below my skis and failed 2' down in a layer of faceted snow that developed in a rocky portion of the slope. I was the second person to enter the slope, and the first rider reached the bottom and waited in a safe spot adjacent to the runout zone. I was neither not caught or carried.

 

What is unusual about this avalanche is that our deep snowpack is opening up lots of terrain that ordinarily wouldn't be accessible in average snowpack years. This slope is steep and rocky, and the avalanche failed in a layer of facets below a layer of rocks - a likely place to find facets, even with a deep snowpack.

I figured the terrain wasn't too consequential, it has no terrain traps.

 

I intentionally ski cut the middle Race Start, skiing left towards the spur between middle and upper. The whole middle bowl ripped from the top and luckily I planned my ski cut well enough. The slope shattered around me but I was easily able to ski 15 feet left to safety on the spur.

 

The wind slab broke about 2' deep, 100' wide and ran 450'. It had much more energy than I anticipated and I'm very grateful I didn't go for a ride. Easily could have been the end of the season for me.

 

Looking back I knew I was gambling on this one. I debated for 10 minutes if I should do it and ultimately made the wrong call. This was an especially foolish decision because I was solo. The slide on the lower start should've been the only red flag I needed.

SNOWPACK AND STORM SUMMARY:  The snowpack in the lower canyon (Blue Cut and down canyon) had a shallow snowpack through most of the winter.  This shallow snowpack developed faceted sugary grains throughout most of the snowpack.  By late February/early March, there was a slab starting to build on top of the weak basal layers.  A very warm and wet storm moved in on March 10 bringing 6 to 8 inches of new dense wet snow.  This alone was not enough to initiate natural avalanches.  The warm temperatures (and possibly a period of rain on snow) caused the entire pack to go isothermal which weakened the faceted snow and initiated the avalanches.

Temperatures stayed warm through the 12th with some additional precipitation.  More natural avalanches released on the 11th and 12th.

A second very warm and wet storm moved in on the 15th with rain on snow in the lower canyon.  This caused another round of natural avalanches.

The combination of both these warm wet storms produced the most significant avalanche cycle that we've seen in Huntington Canyon since 2017.

Soft storm/windslab triggered remotely while skinning up lookers right side of the slope. Additional fracture happened upon 3rd skier dropping into area that approaches 30-32 degrees.

 

Slide appears to have run 150 ft and 250 ft wide. Lower 1/2 of this slope mellows to 25 degrees then gradually flat, so the avy just ran out of juice. I have not seen this slope slide more than the top 1/2. There was heavy wind loading past 2 days and the snowpack here just hit its tipping point.

 

Overall area was getting slabby and very sensitive, cracks were noted on most of skin up, but only shooting 3-5 ft max.

 

Wind was gusting to 30 mph and sun is popping out this afternoon, so I expect conditions to get worse.  Be safe.

We skied The Spire trees and on our way out spotted this natural. It seemed to have gone today, but may have been yesterday after snowfall ceased. I suspect that today's sun/wind caused a piece of the massive cornices above this to break and triggered this avalanche. In a photo I circled what looked like where the cornice gouged through the snow. As near as I could tell, the crown was 4-5'. It looks like the bed surface is the new/old snow interface before the beginning of last week's storm(s). Active loading today on this slope as winds continued to ramp up.  
It looks to have run .25 miles and approx. 700 vert. ft. 

I saw the other reported large naturals. Sobering day and lots to think about as the next storm rolls in.

We aim to learn from accidents like this and offer comments to help others avoid future accidents. All of us at the Utah Avalanche Center has had our own close calls and know how easy it is to make mistakes. Here are some take-a-ways from this accident:


	Both brothers carried an avalanche transceiver, shovel, and probe, along with airbag backpacks and radios for communication.
	Snowmobiles are very useful tools during an avalanche rescue because they allow someone to cover long distances quickly; however, they also cause electro-magnetic interference with transceivers. Identifying and mitigating this interference is crucial. The current recommendation is to be 3 meters away from a snowmobile when searching. They can be used in the signal search phase of a rescue, but you need to stop occasionally move 3 meters away from the snowmobile. If there is no signal, return to the sled and change locations.
	Avalanche airbags can limit burial depth but are much less effective in terrain traps. Additionally, terrain traps tend to cause deep burials because the avalanche debris often accumulates deeper than it would otherwise. Deep burials are very hard to survive.






	Avalanche probes are delicate pieces of equipment and most are generally less than 3 meters long. One piece of equipment the group found very valuable was a Pieps iProbe, an electronic probe that can detect a transceiver signal. Without having a probe strike for some time, this tool helped direct their digging efforts.






	Always only to expose one person to avalanche terrain at one time. It was very lucky in this case that both riders were not buried.

Forecaster Comments: After originally posting this observation as skier triggered based on tracks in and not out. A party that skied this slope the day before checked in with Snowbasin Ski Patrol on Monday April 10th.

 

They had skied a portion of the slope prior to the avalanche and didn't like it so turned around and skinned back out.  That explains the tracks. 



Thank you to the party for for checking in with Snowbasin.

The UAC would like to thank Park City Powder Cats (PCPC) for sharing information about the timeline of the accident and allowing UAC staff access to the avalanche after the incident.

We aim to learn from accidents like this and offer comments to help others avoid future accidents. There were two factors that added challenges to this rescue:

One factor was that the skier who did not survive was buried deeply. Shoveling is the most demanding and time-consuming phase of a rescue which takes longer the deeper a person is buried.

The other factor was that there were two people buried. Rescue becomes more complex and more time consuming when there are multiple people buried by an avalanche.

We think the canal was dammed by snow or ice allowing for pounding of the snow melt.  It was a destructive event, and in a couple spots it looked like flood water pushed a large amount of saturated snow, slush and woody debris down-slope into structures and across the highway....quite a pile of chunky avalanche debris.  Super saturated soils also failed and crossed the road in a few places to the south of where these photos were taken.  

 

In addition to the damage cause by this event, we noticed that the extremely heavy snowfall in the area had collapsed several structures.  Birch and Mink Creeks are running high and fast.

1800.0,8.0,720,"We spent the day skiing the southerly-facing aspects below Cardiff Pass and came across this avalanche between runs. It appears to be skier triggered as there were some tracks adjacent to the slope that slid, as well as what appears to be a track going into the slope at the top.

 

Similar slopes nearby had some wind-loading and am guessing this slope was also wind-loaded. It also faces east which is a leeward aspect from the recent northwest winds.

 

The weak layer is a layer of lower-density snow just above the dust crust. I found this weak layer on Thursday in the Catherine's Pass Area, and it is apparently still reactive as other avalanches reported from Saturday are also failing on this weak layer. 

 

We found no other signs of instability such as cracking and it seems you need a denser slab with some wind-loading to make this weak layer reactive.
