# Plot: AI Helper for DevOps

üöÄ Plot is a powerful command-line tool designed to provide immediate assistance to DevOps professionals. It leverages the capabilities of OpenAI's GPT models to deliver precise command guidance tailored to various operating systems and environments.

## Features üåü

- **Streamlined Command Assistance**: Get specific commands for your operating system without unnecessary clutter.
- **Support for Multiple GPT Models**: Choose between different GPT models like GPT-4 for tailored assistance.
- **Easy Configuration**: Simple commands to set your API key and preferred GPT model.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

To install Plot, simply use pip. Ensure you have Python 3.6 or later installed.

### Setting the API Key

```bash
plot --setkey
```

When prompted, enter your OpenAI API key. This key will be saved and used for future requests.

### Setting the GPT Model

If you want to use a different model than the default GPT-4, you can set it as follows:

```bash
plot --set-model gpt-3.5-turbo
```

This command will save your model choice and use it for all future inquiries.
