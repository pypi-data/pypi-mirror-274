# dbt2looker
Use `dbt2looker-bigquery` to generate Looker view files automatically from dbt models in Bigquery.

This is a fork of dbt2looker that is specific to bigquery.
The intention is to allow one to define most of the simple and tedious lookml settings in dbt.
That way the lookml code gets less bloated, and can be more focused on advanced metrics and explores.

Want a deeper integration between dbt and your BI tool?

**Features**

* **Column descriptions** synced to looker
* **Dimension** for each column in dbt model
* **Define Dimensions** define common lookml settings in dbt like label, group label, hidden
* **Opinionated Primary key** automatically set the first column to be the primary key, and hide it.
* **Dimension groups** for datetime/timestamp/date columns
* **Measures** defined through dbt column `metadata` [see below](#defining-measures)
* Looker types
* Warehouses: BigQuery

## Quickstart

Run `dbt2looker` in the root of your dbt project *after compiling looker docs*.

**Generate Looker view files for all models:**
```shell
dbt docs generate
dbt2looker
```

**Generate Looker view files for all models tagged `prod`**
```shell
dbt2looker --tag prod
```

**Generate Looker view files for all exposed models **
```shell
dbt2looker --exposed_only
```

## Install

**Install from PyPi repository**

Install from pypi into a fresh virtual environment.

```
# Create virtual env
python3.7 -m venv dbt2looker-venv
source dbt2looker-venv/bin/activate

# Install
pip install dbt2looker-bigquery

# Run
dbt2looker
```

**Build from source**

Requires [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) and python >=3.7

For development, it is recommended to use python 3.7:

```
# Ensure you're using 3.7
poetry env use 3.7  
# alternative: poetry env use /usr/local/opt/python@3.7/bin/python3

# Install dependencies and main package
poetry install

# Run dbtlooker in poetry environment
poetry run dbt2looker
```

## Defining measures

You can define looker measures in your dbt `schema.yml` files. For example:

```yaml
models:
  - name: pages
    columns:
      - name: url
        description: "Page url"
      - name: event_id
        description: unique event id for page view
        meta:
            looker:
              hidden: True
              label: event
              group_label: identifiers
              value_format_name: id
              
            looker_measures:
              - type: count_distinct
                sql_distinct_key: ${url}
              - type: count
                value_format_name: decimal_1

```
