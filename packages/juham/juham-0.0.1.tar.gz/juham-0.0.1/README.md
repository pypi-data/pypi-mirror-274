# README for Juham - Juha's Ultimate Home Automation Mess (for now)

Welcome to Juham (TM) - a Python-based home automation system built on InfluxDB and the Mosquitto MQTT broker.

**Note:** This project is currently in the early planning stages and is not yet ready for production use. In its current state,
you might call it "Juha's Ultimate Home Automation Mess," but I'm working hard to turn it into a masterpiece!

The design adheres to the pure object-oriented paradigm, with each supported external system, such as relays and forecast websites,
being abstracted through a dedicated class.

Class and method documentation is decorated for Doxygen, a tool primarily used for generating developer documentation in
C++ ecosystem. It should perhaps be replace with some native Python tool (Sphinx?)

For a detailed list of changes, see the `CHANGELOG <CHANGELOG.md>`_.
