## Introduction

This package provides a comprehensive solution for managing states, drawing graphics, images, and custom fonts on the SH1106 OLED screen. It leverages the capabilities of the luma.oled package to offer an easy-to-use interface for Raspberry Pi and other Linux-based single-board computers.

## Features

- State management for different application screens
- Drawing basic shapes (lines, rectangles)
- Rendering images on the OLED screen
- Custom font support for text rendering

## Installation

To install the package, use pip:

```bash
pip install sh1106-framework
```

## Tools

The package doesn't directly load image files for images and fonts, but instead uses custom JSON bitmap files.

This package comes with two tools: an image utility and a font utility. These take user-supplied image files containing bitmaps, and convert them to json files which the framework can load. This process is split apart from the framework itself in order to reduce load time.

#### Image utility:

The image utility can be accessed with the `sh1106_image_generator` command. It takes in a reference image, which contains one or more bitmaps within itself, and a JSON reference file, containing information about the names of the images for the framework to reference, along with their coordinates and sizes in the reference image.

The reference image can be of any size. Since the SH1106 display is monochromatic, each pixel only has a state of being on or off. In the reference image, an opaque white pixel represents a pixel being on, and any other color represents the pixel being off.

An example image can be found [here](https://github.com/danspage/sh1106-framework/blob/main/useful-assets/example-images.png), and its corresponding JSON file can be found [here](https://github.com/danspage/sh1106-framework/blob/main/useful-assets/example-images.json).

In the example image, the important color is the white, which represents the image's filled in pixels. The black and pink are simply for the sake of keeping track where each individual sub-image is.

In the JSON file, you'll see a list of entries, with arrays of four integers as the values. Bear in mind a single image loaded into the utility can contain multiple images within itself for the framework to use. The key of each entry is the name that the framework will use to reference the image after it's loaded. The four integers in the values represent the X coordinate, Y coordinate, width, and height of the image. The coordinate origin is at the top-left, with the top-left most pixel being 0,0.

If an entry looks like this: `"smiley-face": [10,10,20,15]` the framework will refer to it be the name "smiley-face". It will be 20 pixels wide and 15 pixels tall, and in the reference image provided, it will be at the 11th pixel from the left, and 11th pixel from the top.

To generate an output JSON file for the images, use the following terminal command:
```bash
sh1006_terminal_generator -i/--image <path to reference image> -j/--json <path to reference JSON> -o/--output <path to output file>
```

Then you'll use the output JSON file for initializing images when the framework is loading.

#### Font utility:

The font utility works the exact same as the image utility, except with the `sh1106_font_generator` command instead. Instead of using names for each entry, use the character that you want to assign to the sub-image. The name of the font will be set manually via code upon initialization. The default font that you'll most likely want to include can be found here: [Image](https://github.com/danspage/sh1106-framework/blob/main/useful-assets/default-font.png), [JSON](https://github.com/danspage/sh1106-framework/blob/main/useful-assets/default-font.json)

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Here is a simple example of how to initialize the display and draw a basic shape:

```python
# MAKE SURE TO INCLUDE IMPORT STATEMENTS

def __init():
    SH1106Framework.register_font("default", "default_font.json")
    SH1106Framework.register_images("icons.json")
    
    SH1106Framework.register_routes(
        default_route="splash",
        routes={
            "splash": SplashPage(StateManager)
        }
    )
    
    # Use the I2C port and address of the display
    SH1106Framework.begin(port=1, address=0x3C)
    pass
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    __init()
```

```python
# MAKE SURE TO INCLUDE IMPORT STATEMENTS

import time

class PingPage(State):
    def __init__(self, state_manager):
        self.state_manager = state_manager
    
    def init(self):
        pass

    def enter(self):
        self.time_of_start = time.time()

    def handle_input(self, channel, message):
        pass

    def update(self, dt):
        if time.time() - self.time_of_start > 1:
            self.state_manager.set_state("pong")

    def render(self):
        Drawing.draw_image("weather-rain", 0, 0)
        Drawing.draw_text("Ping", 14, 0)
```

```python
# MAKE SURE TO INCLUDE IMPORT STATEMENTS

import time

class PingPage(State):
    def __init__(self, state_manager):
        self.state_manager = state_manager
    
    def init(self):
        pass

    def enter(self):
        self.time_of_start = time.time()

    def handle_input(self, channel, message):
        pass

    def update(self, dt):
        if time.time() - self.time_of_start > 1:
            self.state_manager.set_state("ping")

    def render(self):
        Drawing.draw_image("weather-storm", 0, 0)
        Drawing.draw_text("Pong", 14, 0)
```

### State Management

Managing different application states can be done as follows:

```python
from sh1106_oled import StateManager

# Initialize the state manager
state_manager = StateManager()

# Define states
def home_screen():
    # Draw home screen content
    pass

def settings_screen():
    # Draw settings screen content
    pass

# Register states
state_manager.add_state("home", home_screen)
state_manager.add_state("settings", settings_screen)

# Switch to a state
state_manager.switch_state("home")
```

### Drawing Graphics

You can draw various graphics like lines, circles, and rectangles:

```python
# Draw a line
display.line((0, 0, 128, 64), fill="white")

# Draw a circle
display.circle((64, 32), 20, outline="white")

display.show()
```

### Custom Fonts

To draw text with custom fonts:

```python
from PIL import ImageFont

# Load a custom font
font = ImageFont.truetype("path/to/font.ttf", 16)

# Draw text
display.text((10, 10), "Hello, World!", font=font, fill="white")

display.show()
```
