## Description

DOI-Extractor-OEG is a tool for extracting all paper's name and DOI from OEG publications.

They are extracted from two main resources:

1) https://portalcientifico.upm.es/es/ipublic/entity/16247 , corresponding to all papers from OEG. 

2) ExistingPapers/ Papers.csv with already extracted data from some OEG papers.

<br>
The resulting information is placed in Outputs folder, which include:

- A dois.txt containing, for each paper, the URL to the pdf if it was founded or if not the doi

- A results.csv, containing the title and the doi of every paper found, in addition to OpenAlex primary location attribute

- A results.json, containing the same information as results.csv but in a json format

```

```doiExtractor.py``` - Contains the functions to extract the name and doi from portalcientifico.upm.es and to merge that information with the existing papers.

```openAlex.py``` - Contains the functions to extract the primary location from openAlex and if the DOI was not found with doiExtractor.py, it tries to extract it using Open Alex.


## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/ptorija/DOI-Extractor-OEG.git
```

2. Change to the DOI-Extractor-OEG directory:
```
cd DOI-Extractor-OEG
```

3. Create a virtual environment:
```
python -m venv .env
```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

(Linux)
```
source .env/bin/activate
```  
(Windows)
 ```
 .env\Scripts\activate
 ``` 

5. Install the package dependencies:
```
pip install -e .
```

## Usage
Download the package from Pypi or install the tool from Github:
```
pip install DataExtractorOEG
```

The tool can be used from the command line with the following argument:
- ```--start``` - To start the doi extraction

The script will execute and extract DOIs from the specified webpage and then merge them with the ones from ExistingPapers.

### Options:
- ```--url <path>``` - Specify the webpage of the group you want to extract the information. Default: Ontology Engieneering Group
- ```--output <path>``` - Specify the path for the output files. Default: Outputs

### Example

1. Install the tool from Pypi ( https://pypi.org/project/DataExtractorOEG/ )
```
pip install DataExtractorOEG
```

2. Start the execution
```
DataExtractorOEG --start
```

When the execution ends, the following files will be saved in doiExtractor/Outputs folder:

- dois.txt

![plot](images\dois_txt.png)

- results.csv

![plot](images\results_csv.png)

- results.json

![plot](images\results_json.png)

#### If you want to use RSEF with the output provided by this tool, follow the following steps

1. Clone RSEF repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/SoftwareUnderstanding/RSEF.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies by running:
```
pip install -e .
```

4. Use RSEF with the extracted results.json from DOI-Extractor-OEG, this will create a downloaded_metadata.json and a processed_metadata.json:
```
rsef process -j <path to results.json>
```
If you didn't execute DOI-Extractor-OEG previously, you can also execute ```DataExtractorOEG --start``` and then the previous command

5. To check the implementations of the papers use:
```
rsef asses -i <path to processed_metadata.json>

-U flag to check Unidirectionality

-B flag to check Bidirectionality
```
