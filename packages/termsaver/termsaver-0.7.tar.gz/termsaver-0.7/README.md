TermSaver
=========

*A simple text-based screensaver for terminal windows.*

![termsaver](https://github.com/brunobraga/termsaver/raw/master/extras/termsaver-main_medium.jpeg)


Background
----------

The motivation behind this project is basically pure boredom (laughs). 
Seriously, it may look like nonsense to have a screensaver look-alike program
running on a terminal window. Nonetheless, sometimes, we still want to see some
kind of movement, or action on the screen... which invigorates one's state of
mind and helps concentration back to the black screen (well, some people like 
it white, meh!).

If you are:

  * looking for some extra display on your main terminal window, to keep the 
    screen busy while you are up to something else; or
  * looking for some distractions that may entertain you after too many hours
    in front of the terminal; or
  * with plenty of screen space (so long 80x25 default terminal window! long 
    live 1920px...), and use many terminals on screen; or
  * just wanting to pretend you are busy with something (this is terrible)

then, TermSaver is the **right** application for you.


Requirements
------------

  * Linux, or Mac (or Windows too, but you are on your own)
  * Python 3.x (Python 2.x was deprecated since 08-2020)


Installation
------------
#### Pip (Pip Installs Packages, for Python Package Index)

For those using others, and still want to do it the easy way, I recommend:

        sudo pip install termsaver


#### From the Source

For the brave (laughs), you can compile/install from the source:

1. Download the Source 
[here](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/termsaver/) or [here](https://github.com/brunobraga/termsaver/)

2. Unpack it
     
        tar -zxvf termsaver-{version}.tar.gz

3. Build it
        cd termsaver-{version}/
        python -m build

3. Install it
        cd dist/
        pip install termsaver-{version}-py3-none-any.whl

### Translation

The internationalization of this application follows same standards of most
applications out there, by using *gettext* and MO/PO files.

The translation is still being finished up, and when it is ready for 
contributor calls, we will post detailed information about the procedure.

As of v0.2, full plugin support is available, find an example here:

Uninstall
----------

### Using Pip (Pip Install Packages, for Python Package Index)

        sudo pip uninstall termsaver


### Manual Uninstall

Just remove manually the following files:

        # For Linux boxes
        rm -rvf /usr/local/bin/termsaver
        
        # change your python version/location here
        rm -rvf /usr/local/lib/python3.x/dist-packages/termsaver* 
        
        rm -rvf /usr/local/share/man/man1/termsaver.1 
        find /usr/local/share/locale/ -name "termsaver.mo" -exec rm -rfv {} \; 

If the actuall location differ from the above, it might be worth it to just
run the find command and look for them yourself (should not be hard):

        find /usr/ -name "*termsaver*"
