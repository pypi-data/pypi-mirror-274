# Baron Weather

## Overview
Baron Weather is a sophisticated toolset designed to enable real-time querying of weather data using the Baron API. It utilizes a swarm of autonomous agents to handle concurrent data requests, optimizing for efficiency and accuracy in weather data retrieval and analysis.

## Features
Baron Weather includes the following key features:
- **Real-time Weather Data Access**: Instantly fetch and analyze weather conditions using the Baron API.
- **Autonomous Agents**: A swarm system for handling multiple concurrent API queries efficiently.
- **Data Visualization**: Tools for visualizing complex meteorological data for easier interpretation.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Python 3.9 or newer
- git installed on your machine

## Installation
