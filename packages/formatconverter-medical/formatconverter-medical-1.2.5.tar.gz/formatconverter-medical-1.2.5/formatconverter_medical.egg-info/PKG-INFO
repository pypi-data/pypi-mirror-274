## formatconverter-medical

_A toolbox for converting medical imaging data between `DICOM`, `NIfTI`, and standard `image` formats._

### Installation

To install, use `pip` to install this package:

    pip install formatconverter-medical

> **Note:** It is recommended to use `formatconverter-medical` on **Python 3.8**.


### Usage


> _**DICOM TO IMAGE FORMAT CONVERSION**_


#### Call `dicom2image` directly from Python script

```python
from toolbox.dicom2image import dicom_to_image
dicom_to_image(path/to/dicom/directory, path/to/image/directory, brightness)
```

- `path/to/dicom/directory` please provide the directory path for the DICOM files. (**type:** *str*)
- `path/to/image/directory` please provide the directory path for the image files. (**type:** *str*)
- `brightness` please provide the brightness to adjust the ndarray image files. (**type:** *float*)

#### Examples of Different Brightness Values


When `brightness` is set to **_0.2_**, the output will be displayed as follows:

> **_DICOM TO NIFTI FORMAT CONVERSION_**

#### Call `dicom2nifti` directly from Python script

```Python
from toolbox.dicom2nifti import dicom_to_nifti

dicom_to_nifti(path/to/dicom/directory, nifti/file/name, path/to/nifti/directory)
```

- `path/to/dicom/directory` please provide the directory path for the DICOM files. (**type:** *str*)
- `path/to/nifti/directory` please provide the directory path for the nifti files. (**type:** *str*)
- `nifti/file/name` please provide the file name for the nifti file. (**type:** _str_)


> **_IMAGE TO NIFTI FORMAT CONVERSION_**
 
#### Call `image2nifti` directly from Python script


```Python
from toolbox.image2nifti import image_to_nifti

image_to_nifti(path/to/image/directory, path/to/nifti/directory, nifti/file/name)
```

`path/to/dicom/directory` please provide the directory path for the DICOM files. (**type:** _str_)
`path/to/nifti/directory` please provide the directory path for the image files. (**type:** _str_)
`nifti/file/name` please provide the file name for the nifti file. (**type:** _str_)


> **_NIFTI TO DICOM CONVERSION_**
 
#### Call `nifti2dicom` directly from Python script


```Python
from toolbox.nifti2dicom import nifti_to_dicom

nifti_to_dicom(path/to/nifti/file, path/to/output/directory)
```

- `path/to/output/directory` please provide the directory path for the NifTI files. (**type:** *str*)
- `path/to/output/directory` please provide the directory path for the DICOM files. (**type:** *str*)


> **_NIFTI TO IMAGE CONVERSION_**


#### Call `nifti2image` directly from Python script


```Python
from toolbox.nifti2image import nifti_to_image

nifti_to_image(path/to/nifti/file, path/to/image/directory)
```

- `path/to/input/directory` please provide the directory path for the NifTI files. (**type:** *str*)
- `path/to/output/directory` please provide the directory path for the image files. (**type:** *str*)
