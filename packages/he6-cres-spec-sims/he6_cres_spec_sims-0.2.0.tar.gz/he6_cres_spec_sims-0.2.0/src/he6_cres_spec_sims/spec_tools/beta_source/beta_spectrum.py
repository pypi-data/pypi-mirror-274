class BetaSpectrum:
    """A class used to produce and interact with the pdf of a beta
    spectrum. Note that the pickled beta spectra are for b = 0. The
    distortion due to b and the necessary renormalization is done here.
    Unnormalized beta spectrum (dNdE_unnormed_SM) based on interpolating
    the cobs_bs look-up table (df). Drew (March 2023) found that 10^4 vs
    10^3 pkled points was a 10^-6 effect and quadratic vs cubic was a
    10^-8 effect. So he went with 10^3 pts and a quadratic interpolation
    (for performance).

    Args:
        isotope (str): Isotope to build BetaSpectrum class for. Currently
            the two options are: "Ne19", "He6". More spectra can be pickled
            based on thecobs (Leendert Hayen's beta spectrum library)
            and put in the 'pickled_spectra' directory. Instructions for
            how to pickle the spectra in the correct format can be found
            ____. TODO: WHERE??? FILL IN LATER..
        b (float): Value for the Fierz Inerference coefficient (little b).
