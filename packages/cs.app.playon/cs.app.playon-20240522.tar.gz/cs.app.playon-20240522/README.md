Includes a nice command line tool.

*Latest release 20240522*:
New superior tv-series/season/episode inference.

## Function `main(argv=None)`

Playon command line mode;
see the `PlayOnCommand` class below.

## Class `PlayOnAPI(cs.service_api.HTTPServiceAPI)`

Access to the PlayOn API.

*Method `PlayOnAPI.__getitem__(self, download_id: int)`*:
Return the recording `TagSet` associated with the recording `download_id`.

*Method `PlayOnAPI.account(self)`*:
Return account information.

*Method `PlayOnAPI.as_contextmanager(cls, self)`*:
Run the generator from the `cls` class specific `__enter_exit__`
method via `self` as a context manager.

Example from `RunState` which subclasses `HasThreadState`,
both of which are `ContextManagerMixin` subclasses:

    class RunState(HasThreadState):
        .....
        def __enter_exit__(self):
            with HasThreadState.as_contextmanager(self):
                ... RunState context manager stuff ...

This runs the `HasThreadState` context manager
around the main `RunState` context manager.

*Property `PlayOnAPI.auth_token`*:
An auth token obtained from the login state.

*Method `PlayOnAPI.available(self)`*:
Return the `TagSet` instances for the available recordings.

*Method `PlayOnAPI.cdsurl_data(self, suburl, _method='GET', headers=None, **kw)`*:

*Method `PlayOnAPI.download(self, download_id: int, filename=None, *, runstate: Optional[cs.resources.RunState] = <function uses_runstate.<locals>.<lambda> at 0x106a6dab0>)`*:
Download the file with `download_id` to `filename_basis`.
Return the `TagSet` for the recording.

The default `filename` is the basename of the filename
from the download.
If the filename is supplied with a trailing dot (`'.'`)
then the file extension will be taken from the filename
of the download URL.

*Method `PlayOnAPI.feature(self, feature_id)`*:
Return the feature `SQLTags` instance for `feature_id`.

*Method `PlayOnAPI.featured_image_url(self, feature_name: str)`*:
URL of the image for a featured show.

*Method `PlayOnAPI.features(self)`*:

*Method `PlayOnAPI.from_playon_date(date_s)`*:
The PlayOn API seems to use UTC date strings.

*Property `PlayOnAPI.jwt`*:
The JWT token.

*Method `PlayOnAPI.login(self)`*:
Perform a login, return the resulting `dict`.
*Does not* update the state of `self`.

*Property `PlayOnAPI.login_expiry`*:
Expiry UNIX time for the login state.

*Method `PlayOnAPI.notifications(self)`*:
Return the notifications.

*Method `PlayOnAPI.queue(self)`*:
Return the `TagSet` instances for the queued recordings.

*Method `PlayOnAPI.recordings(self)`*:
Return the `TagSet` instances for the available recordings.

*Method `PlayOnAPI.renew_jwt(self)`*:
UNUSED

*Method `PlayOnAPI.service(self, service_id: str)`*:
Return the service `SQLTags` instance for `service_id`.

*Method `PlayOnAPI.services(self)`*:
Fetch the list of services.

*Method `PlayOnAPI.suburl(self, suburl, *, api_version=None, headers=None, _base_url=None, **kw)`*:
Override `HTTPServiceAPI.suburl` with default
`headers={'Authorization':self.jwt}`.

*Method `PlayOnAPI.suburl_data(self, suburl, *, raw=False, **kw)`*:
Call `suburl` and return the `'data'` component on success.

Parameters:
* `suburl`: the API subURL designating the endpoint.
* `raw`: if true, return the whole decoded JSON result;
  the default is `False`, returning `'success'` in the
  result keys and returning `result['data']`
Other keyword arguments are passed to the `HTTPServiceAPI.json` method.
