# QNNGDS

## Description
QNNGDS is a toolbox built on top of phidl for device design in the QNN group.
It is made for helping in the design of gds files. The package is composed of 5 main modules:
- design (contains pre-built cells, ready to be added to a design)
- utilities (contains useful functions for building a new cell)
- geometries (contains test structures and geometry tools)
- circuits (contains circuits made of devices)
- devices (contains devices like ntron, htron, snspd)
