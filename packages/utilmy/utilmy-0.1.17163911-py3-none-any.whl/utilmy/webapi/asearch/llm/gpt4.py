Long text generation

Sliding


https://github.com/junruxiong/IncarnaMind




To generate long text sequences using GPT-3 with a sliding window and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), follow these steps:

Chunk and Index: Break down your knowledge base into manageable chunks (e.g., paragraphs or sections) and index these using a vector database to facilitate efficient retrieval. This step is crucial for the RAG's retrieval phase to function effectively.
Sliding Window for Retrieval: Implement a sliding window mechanism on your input text to handle long inputs that exceed GPT-3's token limit. For each window, retrieve relevant context from your indexed knowledge base. This can be done by matching the semantic content of the text window with the indexed chunks using vector similarity.
Merge and Generate: Use the retrieved chunks to augment the input to GPT-3, ensuring that the context for generation is both relevant and concise. This might involve some preprocessing to integrate the input window with the retrieved content smoothly.
Iterate: Move the window across the input text, repeating the retrieval and generation steps. Each new window should slightly overlap with the previous one to maintain context continuity.
Post-process: After generating text for each window, merge the outputs. Handle overlaps intelligently to ensure the text is coherent and there are no abrupt transitions or repetitions.
This approach leverages the strengths of GPT-3 in generating coherent text while using RAG to ensure the content is contextually enriched and accurate, addressing the limitations of GPT-3's fixed input size. For more details on implementing RAG with GPT-3, refer to the Hugging Face Transformers library, which supports integration with external knowledge sources and custom retrieval mechanisms.
