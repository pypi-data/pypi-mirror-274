## 💻 Requeriments
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- you have installed a `python 3.8` or higher

## 🚀 Install sharepoint-crud
- run the command: `pip install sharepoint-crud` to activate the virtual environment
- voilà!

## ☕ Run
To run sharepoint-crud, you need a sharepoint account. You can instanciate an object with the following parameters:

```python
from sharepoint_crud import SharePointCrud

sharepoint = SharePointCrud(
  'https://your-site.sharepoint.com/sites/your-library',
  'your-email@your-domain.com',
  'your-password'
)

```

Actually, is possible download and upload file. An example:

```python
file_content = sharepoint.get_file('your/folder/to/your/file', 'your-file.file_format')

```
An example:
I have a file `example.csv` in the folder `my_library/Shared Files/my_folder` on SharePoint:
```python
from sharepoint_crud import SharePointCrud

file_content = SharePointCrud(
  'https://your-site.sharepoint.com/sites/your-library',
  'your-email@your-domain.com',
  'your-password'
).get_file('my_library/Shared Files/my_folder', 'example.csv')
```
