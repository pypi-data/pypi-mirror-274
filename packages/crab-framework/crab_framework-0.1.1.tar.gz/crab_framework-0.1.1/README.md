# ü¶Ä Crab: Cross-platform Agent Benchmark for Multimodal Embodied Language Model Agents

## Overview

Crab is a framework for building LLM agent benchmark environments in a Python-centric way.

#### Key Features

üåê Cross-platform
* Create build agent environments that support various deployment options including in-memory, Docker-hosted, virtual machines, or distributed physical machines, provided they are accessible via Python functions.
* Let the agent access all the environments in the same time through a unified interface.

‚öô Ô∏èEasy-to-use Configuration
* Add a new action by simply adding a `@action` decorator on a Python function.
* Deine the environment by integrating several actions together.

üìê Novel Benchmarking Suite
* Define tasks and the corresponding evlauators in an intuitive Python-native way.
* Introduce a novel graph evaluator method providing fine-grained metrics.
