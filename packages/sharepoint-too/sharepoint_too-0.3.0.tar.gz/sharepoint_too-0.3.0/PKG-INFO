# SharePoint Too

![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/coverage-100%25-brightgreen)

## Overview

This module will handle authentication for your SharePoint Online/O365 site, allowing you to make straightforward HTTP requests from Python. It extends the commonly used Requests module, meaning that returned objects are familliar, easy to work with and well documented. Leverages [requests_ntlm](https://github.com/requests/requests-ntlm) for authentication.

Inspired by [Sharepy](https://github.com/JonathanHolvey/sharepy) which seems to no longer be maintained.

**NOTE:** Currently handles dealing with SharePoint Lists via handy shortcut methods, but you can currently also call `sp.get(url, *args, **kwargs)` and `sp.post(url, *args, **kwargs)` with manually assembled SharePoint REST URLs and it will work.

## Installation

```bash
python3 -m pip install sharepoint-too
```

## Usage

### Initiate a SharePoint session

```python
from sharepoint_too import SharePointSession
sp = SharePointSession("example.sharepoint.com")
```

### Make an API call

```python
r = sp.get_lists()
```

This will return a Requests `response` object. See the [requests documentation](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) for details. By default, the headers `accept: application/json;odata=verbose` and` content-type: application/json;odata=verbose` are sent with all requests, so API responses will be formatted as JSON where available.

Headers can be added or overridden by supplying a dictionary to the relevant method:

```python
r = sp.get_lists(headers={"Accept": "application/atom+xml"})
```

Currently the `post()` method will send a `x-requestdigest` header, allowing modifications to be made to SharePoint objects.

### Other available methods

```python
sp.get_list_metadata(weblist_url, list_guid=None, list_title=None)
sp.get_list_entity_type(weblist_url, list_guid=None, list_title=None)
sp.get_list_items(weblist_url, list_guid=None, list_title=None)
sp.get_list_item(weblist_url, item_id, list_guid=None, list_title=None)
sp.add_list_item(weblist_url, payload, list_guid=None, list_title=None)
sp.update_list_item(weblist_url, item_id, data, list_guid=None, list_title=None)
sp.upload(weblist_url, item_id, filename, list_guid=None, list_title=None)
sp.delete_list_item(weblist_url, item_id, list_guid=None, list_title=None)
```

**NOTE:** Only `list_guid` or `list_title` need to be supplied, not both.
