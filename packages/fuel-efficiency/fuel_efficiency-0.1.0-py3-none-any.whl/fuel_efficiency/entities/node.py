    A class used to represent a Node

    A Node contain a ``Position(x,y)`` that is a position on a grid and a ``weight`` that represents the weight for a vehicle to move through different
    terrains, that affects its fuel efficiency.

    This class uses ``dataclasses`` that provides a decorator and functions for automatically adding generated special
    methods such as ``__init__()`` and ``__repr__()``
