## Usage

If not called from within an async method

```python
from sungrowinverter inport SungrowInverter
import asyncio
...

client = SungrowInverter("192.168.1.27")

loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
asyncio.set_event_loop(loop)
result = loop.run_until_complete(client.async_update())

#Get a list data returned from the inverter.
print(client.data)
```

If called within an async method in your application
```
from sungrowinverter inport SungrowInverter

client = SungrowInverter("192.168.1.27")
client.async_update()

#Get a list data returned from the inverter.
print(client.model)
print(client.data)
```

** of course change 192.168.1.27 to your inverter's ip address.

## Methods and Variables

### Contructor

`SungrowInverter(ip_address, port=502, slave=0x01, retries=3, timeout=60)`

port: modbus TCP port defaults to 502 on sungrow inverters used here

slave: defaulted to 0x01 as per specs your inverter may need to change this.

retries: number of attempts to query the registers on the inverter before failing

timeout: <in seconds> tcp connection is timed out and fails after this long

### Methods

Available methods

`client.inverter_model()` Returns a object of sungrowinverter.common.SungrowInverterModel with details of model, serial, nominal output power (kWh)

`client.async_update()` Calls set of registers for the relevant inverter and updates data parameter
  
### Parameters Available

#### All inverters
  
  `model:` Provides device model (ie. SH5K - as found in current models supported above)

  `device_code:` Sungrow device code found at register 5000 (refer docs for actual codes if needed)

  `serial_number:` Serial number of the inverter

  `nominal_output_power:` The output power that the inverter supports (ie. SH5K is a 5 kWh inverter and will contain 5.0 in this parameter)

  `inverter_type:` [hybrid | string] - type of sungrow inverter that the client is communicating with, hybrid (battery supported inverter SHxxx series or standard inverter SGxxxx series)

  `mppt_input:` The number of mppt inputs the inverter supports, refer notes below.

  `data:` Provides a dictionary of data of all registers queried (key = register name, value = register value) refer to the https://github.com/mvandersteen/SungrowInverter/tree/main/sungrowinverter/configs for details on what registers are exposed.

#### Hybrid (storage) inverters only
  
  `battery_type:` Show the battery type configured for the inverter

  `battery_energy_capacity:` hybrid only, this will show the capacity of the battery configured for the inverter
  
  
## Note

```
client = SungrowInverter("192.168.1.27")
await client.async_update()
```
  `client.data['export_power']` - for this register it is a signed value if positive then the inverter is exporting to the grid, if negative then it is importing from the grid.

  `client.mppt_inputs` - this value dictates how many client.data['mppt_xx_voltage'] & client.data['mppt_xx_current'] registers are available. These values have been obtained from the modbus specs found in the documents directory on this repository. If an inverter only supports 1 mppt connection then only 1 set of mppt_1_voltage and mppt_1_current will appear. If the inverter supports more then mppt\_\[xx\]\_voltage & mppt\_\[xx\]\_current; where [xx] = the number of mppt inputs the inverter supports; the number available depends on the how many the inverter supports can be 1 to 12 sets of data for current set of support inverters. 
  
## Python Version prior to 3.9

Refer to https://github.com/mvandersteen/SungrowInverter/issues/2 if you are having issues, where @hallonstedt explains how to resolve for a prior version of python.


## Note
2024-05-13: I don't have a sungrow invester to test changes on any longer as house is being rebuilt, will look to update again once new build is complete and solar re-added. For now apologies will not be of much help to anyone other than accepting merge every now and then.

If you have an inverter not supported by this module BUT do get a response back from the sungrow inverter with a device ID, then you could follow what was done for this pull request https://github.com/mvandersteen/SungrowInverter/commit/9bef6dfcc4db7672edb1140b98bbdd34c672a987 by @ortogonal; that is add an entry for your inverter in the inverter list with your deviceID defined. Then if you have a 3 phase inverter (eg. SHxxRT or SGxxRT) add your inverter deviceID returned in unsupported message into the list of valid_inverters in the registers config config sections (see hybrid.py or string.py config files), (eg. ModBusRegister(5020, "phase_b_voltage", "U16", 0.1, VOLTAGE, valid_inverters=[0xE00,0xE01,0xE02,0xE03,0xE0D,0xE0E,0xE0F,0xE13])
