# BPpy: Behavioral Programming In Python
A Python implementation for the Behavioral Programming paradigm

## Installation
You can install ``bppy`` with pip:

```shell
pip install bppy
```

This does not include dependencies for gym integration. To install ``bppy`` with gym integration, use:

```shell
pip install bppy[gym]
```

If installation is not working, you can try upgrading pip:

```shell
pip install --upgrade pip
```

before submitting an issue.

In case you want to get started instantly and use ``bppy`` (with ``pynusmv`` and all dependencies) without installing it, you can use the [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/tomyaacov/bppy-docker):

```shell
docker run -it tomyaacov/bppy-docker
```
