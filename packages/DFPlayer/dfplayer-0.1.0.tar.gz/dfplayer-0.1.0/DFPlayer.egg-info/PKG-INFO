df.random() # play random song
df.next() # play next song
df.previous() # play previous song
df.pause() # pause played song
df.stop() # stop played song
df.loop() # loop current played song
df.loop_all() # loop all songs on the SD card
df.set_volume(60) # set volume to 60%, default is 50
df.get_volume() # get current audio volume
df.set_eq(DFPlayer.EQ_NORMAL) # set equalizer to (EQ_NORMAL, EQ_POP, EQ_ROCK, EQ_JAZZ, EQ_CLASSIC, EQ_BASS), default is EQ_NORMAL
df.get_eq() # get current equalizer
