class APRClassifier:
    """
    Approach is to construct an APR by starting with
    a single positive instance and “growing” the APR by expanding it to cover additional
    positive instances.
    We call it the “iterated discrimination” algorithm, and it has three basic procedures:
    -Grow. An algorithm for growing an APR with “tight” bounds along a specified set
    of features.
    -Discriminate. An algorithm for choosing a set of discriminating features by analyzing
    an APR.
    -Expand. An algorithm for expanding the bounds of an APR to improve its generalization ability.
