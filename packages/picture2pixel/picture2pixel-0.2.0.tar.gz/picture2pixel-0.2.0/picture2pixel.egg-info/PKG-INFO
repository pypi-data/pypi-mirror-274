# Picture2Pixel

By: Chen Guoyi; Fang Sihan. National University of Singapore.

**Picture2Pixel** is an open-source Python library designed to transform images into pixel art that can be displayed on FPGA-driven OLED screens. By employing advanced computer graphics techniques, this library preprocesses images to minimize distortion during the pixelation process. The resulting artwork is expressed as combinations of predicate logic in Verilog language, ensuring compatibility with FPGA technology. This optimization not only enhances display efficiency on OLED screens but also reduces energy consumption, making it ideal for developers looking to integrate low-power, high-efficiency visual displays into their hardware projects.

## Installation

Install the `picture2pixel` package using pip:

```bash
pip install picture2pixel
```

## Usage

### Convert Image to Pixel Data

Convert an image to pixel data and generate Verilog code:

```bash
python -m picture2pixel.convert2pixel <image_url> <width> <height> <svd_r> <output_dir>
```

Example:

```bash
python -m picture2pixel.convert2pixel https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~guoyi/project/picture2pixel/default.png 96 64 20 output_directory
```

### Convert Pixel Data to Image

Convert pixel data from a `.p2p` file back into an image:

```bash
python -m picture2pixel.convert2picture <p2p_file> <width> <height> <output_dir>
```

Example:

```bash
python -m picture2pixel.convert2picture https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~guoyi/project/picture2pixel/default.p2p 96 64 output_directory
```
