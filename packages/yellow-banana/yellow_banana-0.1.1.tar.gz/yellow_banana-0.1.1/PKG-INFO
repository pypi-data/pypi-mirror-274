# Yellow Banana

Yellow Banana is as a template for creating PyPI packages.

In order to create your own package, replace all occurrences of the word "yellow_banana" in the codebase, and rename the `yellow_banana` folder, to whatever you want your package to be called.

## Development

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bloominstituteoftechnology/yellow_banana.git
    cd yellow_banana
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install dependencies

    ```bash

    ```

4. Build and install the package:

    ```bash
    python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
    pip install dist/yellow_banana-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
    ```

5. Run the package:

    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="xyz"
    yellow_banana "What is the meaning of life?"
    ```
