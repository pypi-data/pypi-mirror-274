# GeoRoughness Tool

The GeoRoughness Tool is a comprehensive tool designed for geospatial analysis, allowing users to calculate the surface roughness of Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) using the standard deviation of height within a specified window size. The tool is equipped with both a graphical user interface (GUI) and a command-line interface (CLI), making it versatile for different user preferences and workflows.

## Features

- **GeoTIFF Support**: Load and process DEM data directly from GeoTIFF files.
- **Flexible Window Sizes**: Specify the window size in meters for roughness calculations.
- **Advanced Thresholding**: Configure high value and categorical thresholds to refine processing.
- **Dual Interface**: Operate through a user-friendly GUI or a powerful CLI.
- **Dynamic Previews**: Generate and view pseudo-colored previews of the processed DEM within the GUI.
- **Selective Saving**: Choose when to save processed outputs after reviewing results.

## Documentation

For more detailed information about the tool's capabilities and additional configurations, 
please refer to the [Project's Wiki](../../wiki).

## Installation Guide for GeoRoughness Tool

Follow these steps to install the GeoRoughness Tool on your system. The program is available
as a Python package and can therefore be installed on any major operating system.

> [!TIP]
> If you are not that experienced using command line tools or experience any problems during installation, please refer to the [Getting Started Wiki Page](../../wiki/Getting-Started) for a more detailed and OS specific installation guide.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that your system meets the following requirements:
- **Python 3.12 or later**: The software is built to run with Python 3.12 and above.
- **pip**: Python's package installer, used to install the GeoRoughness Tool.

### Step-by-Step Installation

#### 1. Install Python
Ensure you have Python 3.12 or later installed on your computer:
- **Windows**: Download from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure to add Python to PATH during installation.
- **macOS**: Install using Homebrew with `brew install python@3.12`.
- **Linux**: Use your package manager, e.g., for Ubuntu: `sudo apt install python3.12 python3-pip`.

#### 2. Verify Installation
Check Python and pip installation:
```bash
python3 --version
pip3 --version
```

#### 3. Install GeoRoughness Tool
Install the package via pip:
```bash
pip3 install geo-roughness-tool
```

## Usage

### GUI Application

To launch the GUI, simply run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
georough
```

The graphical interface allows you to browse for input files, set processing parameters, and view the roughness map interactively before deciding to save the output.

### CLI Application

For those who prefer working in a command-line environment, the CLI provides a robust solution. Hereâ€™s how to use it:

```bash
georough --input_path "path/to/input.tif" --output_dir "path/to/output" --window_size 1.0 --band_number 1 --high_value_threshold 1.0 --categorical_thresholds 0.1, 0.2, 0.3
```

### Parameters

- **`--input_path`**: Path to the input GeoTIFF file.
- **`--output_dir`**: Directory where the output files will be saved.
- **`--window_size`** (optional): The size of the window in meters for calculating roughness.
- **`--band_number`** (optional): The specific band of the DEM to process.
- **`--high_value_threshold`** (optional): Threshold to filter out high elevation values.
- **`--categorical_thresholds`** (optional): Set of thresholds to categorize the elevation data.
