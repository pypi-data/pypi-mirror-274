class Motor:
    """
    The Motor class is used to store the properties of a rocket motor. The properties are:

    - dry_mass: mass of the motor without fuel (kg)
    - thrust_curve: dictionary of thrust (N) at time (s after ignition)
    - fuel_mass_curve: dictionary of mass (kg) at time (s after ignition)
    - burn_time: time it takes for the motor to burn all of its fuel (s)

class Rocket:
    """
    The Rocket class is used to store the properties of a rocket. The properties are:

    - rocket_mass: dry mass of the rocket without the motor (kg)
    - motor: Motor object
    - A_rocket: cross-sectional area of the rocket (m^2). Must be the same used when the Cd_rocket_at_Ma was calculated.
    - Cd_rocket_at_Ma: coefficient of drag of the rocket as a function of Mach number. Defaults to a constant 0.45, which is in the ballpark of what most comp rockets our size have.
    - h_second_rail_button: height of the second rail button from the bottom of the rocket (m). This is the upper button if there's only 2. Defaults to 0.69m, which is what Prometheus had. Doesn't matter much if it's not set as it changes apogee by less than 10ft when it's at 0.

    - dry_mass: total mass of the rocket without fuel (kg)
    - Cd_A_rocket: coefficient of drag of the rocket multiplied by the cross-sectional area of the rocket (m^2)

class LaunchConditions:
    """
    The LaunchConditions class is used to store the properties of the launch conditions. The properties are:

    - launchpad_pressure: pressure at the launchpad (Pa)
    - launchpad_temp: temperature at the launchpad (°C)
    - L_launch_rail: length of the launch rail (m)
    - launch_angle: launch angle from horizontal (deg). SAC comp rules say minimum of 6 deg off of vertical, but they pick it based on wind and pad location, so completely out of our control, and we just know it's between 6 and 15 deg
    - local_gravity: acceleration due to gravity at the launch site (m/s^2). Defaults to 9.807
    - local_T_lapse_rate: temperature lapse rate at the launch site (°C/m, K/m). Defaults to -0.0065
    - latitude: latitude of the launch site (deg). Used to calculate local gravity if local_gravity is not provided. If neither are provided, local gravity defaults to 9.807
    - altitude: altitude of the launch site (m ASL). Defaults to 0

class Airbrakes:

    The Airbrakes class is used to store the properties of the airbrakes. The properties are:

    - num_flaps: number of airbrakes flaps
    - A_flap: cross-sectional area of each flap (m^2)
    - Cd_brakes: coefficient of drag of the airbrakes
