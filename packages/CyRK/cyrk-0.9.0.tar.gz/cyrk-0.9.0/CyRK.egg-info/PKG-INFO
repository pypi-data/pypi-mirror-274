        **Using Creative Commons Public Licenses**
        
        Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.
        
        * __Considerations for licensors:__ Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected.

        ### Section 2 – Scope.
        
        a. ___License grant.___
        
           1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
        
               A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and
        
               B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
        
           2. __Exceptions and Limitations.__ For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.
        
           3. __Term.__ The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).
        
           4. __Media and formats; technical modifications allowed.__ The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.

               A. __Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material.__ Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.
        
               B. __Additional offer from the Licensor – Adapted Material.__ Every recipient of Adapted Material from You automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material under the conditions of the Adapter’s License You apply.
        
               C. __No downstream restrictions.__ You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.
        
           6. __No endorsement.__ Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
        
        b. ___Other rights.___
        
           1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.
        
           2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.
        
           3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.
        
        ### Section 3 – License Conditions.
        
        Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.

        2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share Adapted Material.
        
        3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.
        
        ### Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.
        
        Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
        
        a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;
        
        b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(b); and
        
        c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
        
        For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
        
        ### Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
        
        a. __Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.__
        
        b. __To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.__
        
        c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.
        
        ### Section 6 – Term and Termination.
        
        a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.
        
        b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:
        
           1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
        
           2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
        
           For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.
        
        c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.
        
        d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.
        
        ### Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.
        
        a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
        
        b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.
        
        ### Section 8 – Interpretation.
        
        a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.
        
        b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.
        
        c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.
        
        d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

**Runge-Kutta ODE Integrator Implemented in Cython and Numba**

CyRK provides fast integration tools to solve systems of ODEs using an adaptive time stepping scheme. CyRK can accept differential equations that are written in pure Python, njited numba, or cython-based cdef class methods. These kinds of functions are generally easier to implement than pure c functions and can be used in existing Python software. Using CyRK can speed up development time while avoiding the slow performance that comes with using pure Python-based solvers like SciPy.

The purpose of this package is to provide some 
functionality of [scipy's solve_ivp](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.solve_ivp.html) with greatly improved performance.

Currently, CyRK's [numba](https://numba.discourse.group/) (njit-safe) implementation is **10-120+x faster** than scipy's solve_ivp function.
The [cython](https://cython.org/) `cyrk_ode` function that works with python (or numba) functions is **20-40+x faster** than scipy.
The [cython](https://cython.org/) `CySolver` class that works with cython-based cdef classes is **30-500+x faster** than scipy.

An additional benefit of the two cython implementations is that they are pre-compiled. This avoids most of the start-up performance hit experienced by just-in-time compilers like numba.

## Installation

*CyRK has been tested on Python 3.8--3.11; Windows, Ubuntu, and MacOS.*

To install simply open a terminal and call:

`pip install CyRK`

If not installing from a wheel, CyRK will attempt to install `Cython` and `Numpy` in order to compile the source code. 
After everything has been compiled, cython will be uninstalled and CyRK's runtime dependencies (see the pyproject.toml file for the latest list) will be installed instead.

A new installation of CyRK can be tested quickly by running the following from a python console.
```python
from CyRK import test_cyrk, test_nbrk, test_cysolver
test_cyrk()
# Should see "CyRK's cyrk_ode was tested successfully."
test_nbrk()
# Should see "CyRK's nbrk_ode was tested successfully."
test_cysolver()
# Should see "CyRK's CySolver was tested successfully."
```

### Troubleshooting Installation and Runtime Problems

*Please [report](https://github.com/jrenaud90/CyRK/issues) installation issues. We will work on a fix and/or add workaround information here.*

- If you see a "Can not load module: CyRK.cy" or similar error then the cython extensions likely did not compile during installation. Try running `pip install CyRK --no-binary="CyRK"` 
to force python to recompile the cython extensions locally (rather than via a prebuilt wheel).
- On MacOS: If you run into problems installing CyRK then reinstall using the verbose flag (`pip install -v .`) to look at the installation log. If you see an error that looks like "clang: error: unsupported option '-fopenmp'" then you may have a problem with your `llvm` or `libomp` libraries. It is recommended that you install CyRK in an [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) environment with the following packages `conda install numpy scipy cython llvm-openmp`. See more discussion [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/xformers/issues/157) and the steps taken [here](https://github.com/jrenaud90/CyRK/blob/main/.github/workflows/push_tests_mac.yml).
- CyRK has a number of runtime status codes which can be used to help determine what failed during integration. Learn more about these codes [https://github.com/jrenaud90/CyRK/blob/main/Documentation/Status%20and%20Error%20Codes.md](here).

### Development and Testing Dependencies

If you intend to work on CyRK's code base you will want to install the following dependencies in order to run CyRK's test suite and experimental notebooks.

`conda install pytest scipy matplotlib jupyter`

`conda install` can be replaced with `pip install` if you prefer.

## Using CyRK
CyRK's API is similar to SciPy's solve_ivp function. A differential equation can be defined in python such as:

```python
import numpy as np

# For even more speed up you can use numba's njit to compile the diffeq
from numba import njit
@njit
def diffeq_nb(t, y):
    dy = np.empty_like(y)
    dy[0] = (1. - 0.01 * y[1]) * y[0]
    dy[1] = (0.02 * y[0] - 1.) * y[1]
    return dy

initial_conds = np.asarray((20., 20.), dtype=np.complex128, order='C')
time_span = (0., 50.)
rtol = 1.0e-7
atol = 1.0e-8
```

### Numba-based `nbrk_ode`
The system of ODEs can then be solved using CyRK's numba solver by,

```python
from CyRK import nbrk_ode
time_domain, y_results, success, message = \
    nbrk_ode(diffeq_nb, time_span, initial_conds, rk_method=1, rtol=rtol, atol=atol)
```

### Cython-based `cyrk_ode`
To call the cython version of the integrator you need to slightly edit the differential equation so that it does not
return the derivative. Instead, the output is passed as an input argument (a `np.ndarray`) to the function. 

```python
@njit
def diffeq_cy(t, y, dy):
    dy[0] = (1. - 0.01 * y[1]) * y[0]
    dy[1] = (0.02 * y[0] - 1.) * y[1]
```

Alternatively, you can use CyRK's conversion helper functions to automatically convert between numba/scipy and cyrk function calls.

```python
from CyRK import nb2cy, cy2nb

@njit
def diffeq_nb(t, y):
    dy = np.empty_like(y)
    dy[0] = (1. - 0.01 * y[1]) * y[0]
    dy[1] = (0.02 * y[0] - 1.) * y[1]
    return dy

diffeq_cy = nb2cy(diffeq_nb, use_njit=True)
diffeq_nb2 = cy2nb(diffeq_cy, use_njit=True)
```

You can then call the ODE solver in a similar fashion as the numba version.

```python
from CyRK import cyrk_ode
time_domain, y_results, success, message = \
    cyrk_ode(diffeq_cy, time_span, initial_conds, rk_method=1, rtol=rtol, atol=atol)
```

### Cython-based `CySolver`
The cython-based `CySolver` class requires writing a new cython cdef class. This is done in a new cython .pyx file which must then be cythonized and compiled before it can be used.

```cython
"""ODE.pyx"""
# distutils: language = c++
# cython: boundscheck=False, wraparound=False, nonecheck=False, cdivision=True, initializedcheck=False

from CyRK.cy.cysolver cimport CySolver
# Note the `cimport` here^

cdef class MyCyRKDiffeq(CySolver):

    cdef void diffeq(self) noexcept nogil:
        
        # Unpack dependent variables using the `self.y_ptr` variable.
        # In this example we have a system of two dependent variables, but any number can be used.
        cdef double y0, y1
        y0 = self.y_ptr[0]
        y1 = self.y_ptr[1]

        # Unpack any additional arguments that do not change with time using the `self.args_ptr` variable.
        cdef double a, b
        # These must be float64s
        a  = self.args_ptr[0]
        b  = self.args_ptr[1]

        # If needed, unpack the time variable using `self.t_now`
        cdef double t
        t = self.t_now

        # This then updates dydt by setting the values of `self.dy_ptr`
        self.dy_ptr[0] = (1. - a * y1) * y0
        self.dy_ptr[1] = (b * y0 - 1.) * y1
```

Once you compile the differential equation it can be imported in a regular python file and used in a similar fashion to the other integrators.

```python
"""run.py"""
from ODE import MyCyRKDiffeq

# It is important that any arrays passed to the CySolver are C-contiguous (set with numpy with "order=C")
# Also, currently, CySolver only works with floats/doubles. Not complex.
initial_conds = np.asarray((20., 20.), dtype=np.float64, order='C')

# Need to make an instance of the integrator.
# The diffeq no longer needs to be passed to the class.
MyCyRKDiffeqInst = MyCyRKDiffeq(time_span, initial_conds, args=(0.01, 0.02), rk_method=1, rtol=rtol, atol=atol, auto_solve=True)

# To perform the integration make a call to the solve method.
# Only required if the `auto_solve` flag is set to False (defaults to True)
# MyCyRKDiffeqInst.solve()

# Once complete, you can access the results via...
MyCyRKDiffeqInst.success     # True / False
MyCyRKDiffeqInst.message     # Note about integration
MyCyRKDiffeqInst.t           # Time domain
MyCyRKDiffeqInst.y           # y dependent variables
MyCyRKDiffeqInst.extra       # Extra output that was captured during integration.
# See Documentation/Extra Output.md for more information on `extra`
```

## Optional Arguments

All three integrators can take the following optional inputs:
- `rtol`: Relative Tolerance (default is 1.0e-6).
- `atol`: Absolute Tolerance (default is 1.0e-8).
- `rtols`: A numpy ndarray of relative tolerances set for each y0 (default is None; e.g., use `rtol` for each).
- `atols`: A numpy ndarray of absolute tolerances set for each y0 (default is None; e.g., use `atol` for each).
- `max_step`: Maximum step size (default is +infinity).
- `first_step`: Initial step size (default is 0).
  - If 0, then the solver will try to determine an ideal value.
- `args`: Python tuple of additional arguments passed to the `diffeq`.
  - For the cython solvers these arguments must be floating point numbers only.
- `t_eval`: Both solvers uses an adaptive time stepping protocol based on the recent error at each step. This results in a final non-uniform time domain of variable size. If the user would like the results at specific time steps then they can provide a np.ndarray array at the desired steps via `t_eval`. The solver will then interpolate the results to fit this array.
- `rk_method`: Runge-Kutta method (default is 1; all of these methods are based off of
[SciPy implementations](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.solve_ivp.html)):
  - `0` - "RK23" Explicit Runge-Kutta method of order 3(2).
  - `1` - "RK45" Explicit Runge-Kutta method of order 5(4).
  - `2` - "DOP853" Explicit Runge-Kutta method of order 8.
- `capture_extra` and `interpolate_extra`: CyRK has the capability of capturing additional parameters during integration. Please see `Documentation\Extra Output.md` for more details.
- `max_num_steps`: Maximum number of steps the solver is allowed to use. Defaults to system architecture's max size for ints.

### Additional Arguments for `cyrk_ode` and `CySolver`
- `num_extra` : The number of extra outputs the integrator should expect.
  - Please see `Documentation\Extra Output.md` for more details.
- `expected_size` : Best guess on the expected size of the final time domain (number of points).
    - The integrator must pre-allocate memory to store results from the integration. It will attempt to use arrays sized to `expected_size`. However, if this is too small or too large then performance will be negatively impacted. It is recommended you try out different values based on the problem you are trying to solve.
    - If `expected_size=0` (the default) then the solver will attempt to guess a best size. Currently this is a very basic guess so it is not recommended.
    - It is better to overshoot than undershoot this guess.

## Limitations and Known Issues

- [Issue 30](https://github.com/jrenaud90/CyRK/issues/30): CyRK's CySolver does not allow for complex-valued dependent variables.
