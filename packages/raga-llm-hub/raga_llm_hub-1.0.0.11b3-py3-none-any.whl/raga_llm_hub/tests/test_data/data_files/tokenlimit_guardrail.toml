prompt="In recent years, the field of artificial intelligence has seen exponential growth and remarkable advancements.From natural language processing to computer vision, AI technologies have permeated various aspects of our daily lives.However, amidst this rapid progress, it's crucial to ensure that AI systems are developed and deployed responsibly. One fundamental aspect to consider is the length of tokens used in processing language data. Token length can significantly impact the performance and efficiency of AI models. Longer tokens may pose challenges for processing and may require more computational resources, while shorter tokens could lead to loss of context or information. Therefore, in this test, we aim to analyse the effects of varying token lengths on the performance of language models. By examining token length across different contexts and prompts, we can gain insights into optimising AI systems for better efficiency and accuracy."
expected_result="the test will fail and will give the truncated prompt"
