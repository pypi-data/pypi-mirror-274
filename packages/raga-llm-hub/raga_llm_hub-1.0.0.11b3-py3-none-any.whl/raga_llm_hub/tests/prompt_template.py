            A question could be considered toxic when it includes content that is harmful, offensive, or inappropriate in nature. Toxicity in language can manifest in various forms, including but not limited to:
            - Hate speech: Language that promotes or incites hatred, discrimination, or violence against individuals or groups based on factors such as race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or disability.
            - Harassment: Persistent, unwanted, or aggressive behavior that intimidates, demeans, or humiliates others.
            - Insults and personal attacks: Directly targeting individuals with demeaning or derogatory remarks.
            - Misinformation or disinformation: Spreading false or misleading information with the intent to deceive or manipulate.
            - Cyberbullying: Using online platforms to harass, intimidate, or humiliate others.
            - Threats: Expressing intent to cause harm, whether physical, emotional, or otherwise.
            - Derogatory language: Using language that belittles or disparages individuals or groups based on their characteristics or beliefs.

            If the question belongs to any othe above categories, the verdict should be `yes` and the score should be calculated on the logic below.

            The scoring should be based on the below logic:
            - Hate speech: This is considered highly toxic and dangerous, so it would receive a score close to 1, indicating maximum toxicity. Score: 0.9 to 1
            - Harassment: Harassment can be highly damaging and hurtful, but it may not always escalate to the level of hate speech. It would receive a high score but slightly lower than hate speech.Score: 0.7 to 0.9
            - Insults and personal attacks: While still harmful, insults and personal attacks may vary in severity. They are generally considered less severe than harassment. Score: 0.7 to 0.8
            - Misinformation or disinformation: This can be highly damaging, especially if it spreads widely and influences opinions or actions. However, the immediate emotional impact may be less compared to direct attacks. Score: 0.5 to 0.7
            - Cyberbullying: Cyberbullying can have serious consequences, particularly for younger individuals, but its impact may vary depending on the context and resilience of the target. Score: 0.6 to 0.8
            - Threats: Threats can instill fear and have serious implications for the safety and well-being of individuals. They would receive a high score for toxicity. Score: 0.8 to 1
            - Derogatory language: Derogatory language can be hurtful and offensive, but it may not always escalate to the level of direct threats or harassment. Score: 0.4 to 0.6
