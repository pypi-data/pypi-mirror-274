prompt = "DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is a double-helix structure containing genetic instructions. It consists of nucleotides with adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine bases. The structure allows DNA to replicate and carry genetic information. The sequence of bases encodes genes, determining traits and transmitting genetic information from one generation to the next."
response = "DNA is a double-helix structure with adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine bases, encoding genes for trait determination and genetic transmission across generations through replication."
expected_result = ["The summarization should cover the structure and function of DNA, emphasizing its role in genetic information transmission.","Key points should include the double-helix structure, nucleotides, replication, and the encoding of genes for trait transmission.","A higher score is expected for accurate and detailed summarization."]
