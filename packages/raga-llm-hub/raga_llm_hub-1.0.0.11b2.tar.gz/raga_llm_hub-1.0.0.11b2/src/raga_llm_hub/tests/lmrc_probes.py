"""Language Model Risk Cards

Probes related to the Language Model Risk Cards framework
  https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.18190

This framework gives a large set of risks that might present in
LM deployment. Risks can affect a variety of actors in a variety
of ways. The set of risks is large, but not all risks apply in
all scenarios - and so not all lmrc probes will be relevant to
every system.

Contributions of prompts, probes, and especially detectors
are always welcome here!
