prompt = "Explain the process of photosynthesis."
response = "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose."
expected_response = "It converts light energy into glucose."
context = "Biology class"
expected_result = "The response is concise and captures the key information about photosynthesis, so the conciseness score should be high."

prompt = "Describe the plot of 'Romeo and Juliet'."
response = "In Verona, two noble families, the Montagues and Capulets, have a long-standing feud. Romeo, a Montague, falls in love with Juliet, a Capulet. Tragedy ensues as their love defies the family conflict."
expected_response = "Romeo and Juliet fall in love despite their families' feud, leading to tragedy."
context = "English literature discussion"
expected_result = "The response is concise and effectively summarizes the plot, so the conciseness score should be high."

[3]
prompt = "Explain the theory of relativity."
response = "Albert Einstein's theory of relativity consists of two parts: special relativity and general relativity. It fundamentally redefines our understanding of space, time, and gravity, introducing concepts like time dilation and the curvature of spacetime."
expected_response = "Einstein's theory redefines space, time, and gravity, introducing time dilation and spacetime curvature."
context = "Physics lecture"
expected_result = "The response provides a concise summary of Einstein's theory of relativity, so the conciseness score should be high."

[4]
prompt = "Discuss the causes of climate change."
response = "Climate change is primarily caused by human activities, including the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. Greenhouse gas emissions lead to global warming, melting ice caps, and extreme weather events."
expected_response = "Human activities like burning fossil fuels and deforestation cause climate change by emitting greenhouse gases."
context = "Environmental science class"
expected_result = "The response is concise and captures the main causes of climate change, resulting in a high conciseness score."

[5]
prompt = "Explain the process of cellular respiration."
response = "Cellular respiration is the metabolic process in which cells generate energy from glucose. It involves three main stages: glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. Through these steps, cells produce ATP, the primary energy currency of the cell."
expected_response = "Cellular respiration generates energy from glucose through glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation, producing ATP."
context = "Biochemistry lecture"
expected_result = "The response succinctly describes the key stages of cellular respiration, leading to a high conciseness score."
