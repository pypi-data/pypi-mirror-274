## About

`idc-index` is a Python package that enables query of the basic metadata and
download of DICOM files hosted by the
[NCI Imaging Data Commons (IDC)](https://imaging.datacommons.cancer.gov).

## Usage

There are no prerequisites - just install the package ...

```bash
$ pip install idc-index
```

... and download files corresponding to any collection, DICOM
PatientID/Study/Series as follows:

```python
from idc_index import index

client = index.IDCClient()

all_collection_ids = client.get_collections()

client.download_from_selection(collection_id="rider_pilot", downloadDir="/some/dir")
```

... or run queries against the "mini" index of Imaging Data Commons data!

```python
from idc_index import index

client = index.IDCClient()

query = """
SELECT
  collection_id,
  STRING_AGG(DISTINCT(Modality)) as modalities,
  STRING_AGG(DISTINCT(BodyPartExamined)) as body_parts
FROM
  index
GROUP BY
  collection_id
ORDER BY
  collection_id ASC
"""

client.sql_query(query)
```

Details of the attributes included in the index are in the release notes.

## Tutorial

This package was first presented at the 2023 Annual meeting of Radiological
Society of North America (RSNA) Deep Learning Lab
[IDC session](https://github.com/RSNA/AI-Deep-Learning-Lab-2023/tree/main/sessions/idc).

Please check out
[this tutorial notebook](https://github.com/ImagingDataCommons/IDC-Tutorials/blob/master/notebooks/labs/idc_rsna2023.ipynb)
for the introduction into using `idc-index` for navigating IDC data.

## Resources

- [Imaging Data Commons Portal](https://imaging.datacommons.cancer.gov/) can be
  used to explore the content of IDC from the web browser
- [s5cmd](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd) is a highly efficient, open source,
  multi-platform S3 client that we use for downloading IDC data, which is hosted
  in public AWS and GCS buckets. Distributed on PyPI as
  [s5cmd](https://pypi.org/project/s5cmd/).
- [SlicerIDCBrowser](https://github.com/ImagingDataCommons/SlicerIDCBrowser) 3D
  Slicer extension that relies on `idc-index` for search and download of IDC
  data
