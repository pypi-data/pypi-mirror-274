# singletCode 

singletCode is a framework designed to identify true singlets in barcoded sequencing datasets. It utilizes a CSV file containing cell ID, barcode, and sample name to detect singlets within the dataset.

## Getting Started

For detailed instructions on how to use SingletCode, including setup, input file formats, and execution commands, please visit our [documentation](https://goyallab.github.io/SingletCodeWebsite/).

## Features

- **Singlet Identification**: Efficiently identifies true singlets from barcoded sequencing data.
- **Easy Input**: Works with a simple CSV file format that includes cell ID, barcode, and sample name.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed guides and usage instructions available.

## Installation

To install SingletCode, ensure that you have a compatible Python environment. For installation instructions, dependencies, and more, refer to the [SingletCode documentation](https://goyallab.github.io/SingletCodeWebsite/).

## Usage

After installation, you can run SingletCode with your dataset by following the detailed usage instructions available in our [documentation](https://goyallab.github.io/SingletCodeWebsite/).
