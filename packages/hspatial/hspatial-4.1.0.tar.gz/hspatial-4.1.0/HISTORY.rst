History
=======

4.1.0 (2024-05-22)
==================

- extract_point_from_raster() now also accepts a GDALRaster object.

4.0.1 (2024-04-22)
==================

- Updated requirements to be compatible with Django 4 and 5.

4.0.0 (2024-04-14)
==================

- Now works with htimeseries 6 and 7.
- PointTimeseries() has changed in that default_time must be aware.

3.0.0 (2024-04-01)
==================

- Now requires htimeseries 6. This recent htimeseries version works with
  aware time zones, and hspatial, which works with naive, internally
  handles them as UTC.

2.1.6 (2024-04-01)
==================

- Reverted previous change, which had not been properly tested and
  doesn't work; in effect 2.1.6 is the same as 2.1.4.

2.1.5 (2024-03-31)
==================

- Added compatibility with htimeseries 6.

2.1.4 (2021-08-31)
==================

- Added compatibility with gdal 3.

2.1.3 (2021-04-13)
==================

- Updated dependencies (essentially htimeseries).

2.1.2 (2021-04-08)
==================

- Updated requirements to be compatible with Django 3.

2.1.1 (2021-01-05)
==================

- Fixed an error in extract_point_from_raster(). It was sometimes
  picking up a neigbouring pixel instead of the correct one.

2.1.0 (2020-10-02)
==================

- h_integrate() now adds a "UNIT" metadata item to the produced raster
  with the unit of measurement as specified in the input files.
  Conversely, PointTimeseries reads the "UNIT" metadata item from the
  rasters and sets it in the returned HTimeseries object.

2.0.0 (2020-01-05)
==================

- Now uses version 5 of hts file (i.e. different time step notation).

1.3.0 (2019-12-12)
==================

- Added option default_time to PointTimeseries.

1.2.2 (2019-11-24)
==================

- Fixed a bug where extract_point_from_raster() was modifying the point
  passed to it.

1.2.1 (2019-10-23)
==================

- Fixed a bug where hts files were opened in the wrong mode, with
  inconsistent results (this is another occurence of the bug that had
  been fixed in 0.1.2).

1.2.0 (2019-09-11)
==================

- Added test utility setup_test_raster() to make unit testing easier.

1.1.0 (2019-08-23)
==================

- Added option "version" to PointTimeseries.get_cached() so that it can
  save in different file format versions.

1.0.1 (2019-08-22)
==================

- Fixed a bug in extract_point_from_timeseries() where it was sometimes
  raising the wrong exception type (depending on GDAL version).

1.0.0 (2019-08-16)
==================

- The API for extract_point_timeseries_from_rasters() has changed.
  Instead of a function, there's now a PointTimeseries class.
- When extracting a point timeseries from rasters, start_date and
  end_date can now be specified.

0.2.0 (2019-08-13)
==================

- When extracting point time series from a set of rasters, it is now
  possible to provide a prefix as well as a list of files, and it is
  also possible to save the extracted time series to a file, optionally
  only if the file is outdated.
- extract_point_from_raster (and extract_point_timeseries_from_rasters)
  now supports GeoDjango (GEOS) Point objects besides GDAL Point
  objects.
- Function coordinates2point has been added.

0.1.2 (2019-07-30)
==================

- Fixed a bug where hts files were opened in the wrong mode, with
  inconsistent results.

0.1.1 (2019-07-05)
==================

- Fixed an ugly timezone bug that caused the data to refer to a
  different time than what the timestamp actually said.
- When the timezone was missing from the input files, there was an
  incomprehensible AttributeError. This was fixed and now it provides an
  understandable error message.

0.1.0 (2019-06-21)
==================

- Initial release
