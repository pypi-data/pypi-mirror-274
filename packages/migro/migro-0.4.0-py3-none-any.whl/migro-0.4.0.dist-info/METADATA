## Setup

1. Install `migro` in a [dbt](https://getdbt.com) project.

        pip install migro

1. Create a migration. For example:

        mkdir migrations
        migro make create_bobby_tables_user

1. Open the sql file in the `migrations` folder and add this statement.

        create user bobby_tables password='{{ password }}';
        -- Redshift syntax:
        -- create user bobby_tables with password '{{ password }}';

1. Pretend to run the migration. Notice the password generated by the `{{ password }}` jinja template.

        migro up --pretend --limit=1

1. Now run the migration.

        migro up

1. Query the new migrations table to see the migration history.

        select * from public.migrations order by id;
