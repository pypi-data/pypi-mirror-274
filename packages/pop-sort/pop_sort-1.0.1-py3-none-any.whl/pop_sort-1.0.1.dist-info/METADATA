# Popular sorting
Library containing some of the most popular sorting algorithms to play around with.\
At the moment library has the following algorithms implemented:
- Bubble Sort
- Bucket Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Selection Sort

# How to install
```pip install pop-sort```
# How to use
There are few examples on how to use this library in use_examples directory. All algorithms have optional reverse value
which can be used if sorted array in reverse order is needed

Example:\
<code>sorted_offers = quick_sort([5, 8, 4, 15, 111, 1, 22, 1, 5, 10])  
print(f"Here are best offers: {sorted_offers}")</code>
