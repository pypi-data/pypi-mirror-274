Bonito is an open source research basecaller for Oxford Nanopore reads.

For anything other than basecaller training or method development please use [dorado](https://github.com/nanoporetech/dorado).

```bash
$ pip install --upgrade pip
$ pip install ont-bonito
$ bonito basecaller dna_r10.4.1_e8.2_400bps_hac@v5.0.0 /data/reads > basecalls.bam
```

Bonito supports writing aligned/unaligned `{fastq, sam, bam, cram}`.

```bash
$ bonito basecaller dna_r10.4.1_e8.2_400bps_hac@v5.0.0 --reference reference.mmi /data/reads > basecalls.bam
```

Bonito will download and cache the basecalling model automatically on first use but all models can be downloaded with -

``` bash
$ bonito download --models --show  # show all available models
$ bonito download --models         # download all available models
```

## Transformer Models

The `bonito.transformer` package requires
[flash-attn](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention?tab=readme-ov-file#installation-and-features).

This must be manually installed as the `flash-attn` packaging system prevents it from being listed as a normal dependency.

Setting `CUDA_HOME` to the relevant library directory will help avoid CUDA version mismatches between packages.

## Modified Bases

Modified base calling is handled by [Remora](https://github.com/nanoporetech/remora).

```bash
$ bonito basecaller dna_r10.4.1_e8.2_400bps_hac@v5.0.0 /data/reads --modified-bases 5mC --reference ref.mmi > basecalls_with_mods.bam
```

See available modified base models with the ``remora model list_pretrained`` command.

## Training your own model

To train a model using your own reads, first basecall the reads with the additional `--save-ctc` flag and use the output directory as the input directory for training.

```bash
$ bonito basecaller dna_r10.4.1_e8.2_400bps_hac@v5.0.0 --save-ctc --reference reference.mmi /data/reads > /data/training/ctc-data/basecalls.sam
$ bonito train --directory /data/training/ctc-data /data/training/model-dir
```

In addition to training a new model from scratch you can also easily fine tune one of the pretrained models.

```bash
bonito train --epochs 1 --lr 5e-4 --pretrained dna_r10.4.1_e8.2_400bps_hac@v5.0.0 --directory /data/training/ctc-data /data/training/fine-tuned-model
```

If you are interested in method development and don't have you own set of reads then a pre-prepared set is provide.

```bash
$ bonito download --training
$ bonito train /data/training/model-dir
```

All training calls use Automatic Mixed Precision to speed up training. To disable this, set the `--no-amp` flag to True.

## Developer Quickstart

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/nanoporetech/bonito.git  # or fork first and clone that
$ cd bonito
$ python3 -m venv venv3
$ source venv3/bin/activate
(venv3) $ pip install --upgrade pip
(venv3) $ pip install -e .[cu118] --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

The `ont-bonito[cu118]` and `ont-bonito[cu121]` optional dependencies can be used, along
with the corresponding `--extra-index-url`, to ensure the PyTorch package matches the
local CUDA setup.

## Interface

 - `bonito view` - view a model architecture for a given `.toml` file and the number of parameters in the network.
 - `bonito train` - train a bonito model.
 - `bonito evaluate` - evaluate a model performance.
 - `bonito download` - download pretrained models and training datasets.
 - `bonito basecaller` - basecaller *(`.fast5` -> `.bam`)*.

### Research Release

Research releases are provided as technology demonstrators to provide early access to features or stimulate Community development of tools. Support for this software will be minimal and is only provided directly by the developers. Feature requests, improvements, and discussions are welcome and can be implemented by forking and pull requests. However much as we would like to rectify every issue and piece of feedback users may have, the developers may have limited resource for support of this software. Research releases may be unstable and subject to rapid iteration by Oxford Nanopore Technologies.
