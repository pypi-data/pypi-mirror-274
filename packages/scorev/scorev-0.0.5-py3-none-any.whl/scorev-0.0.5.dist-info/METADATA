scorev is a PyPI tool for scoring COVID-19 policies in a filename 'oecd.csv' with vaccine rates 
such as at least 1 dose, fully vaccinated, and booster given.

scorev subsumes PyPI scorecovid application.

The score is calculated by dividing the number of deaths due to COVID-19 by the population in millions.
Generated result.csv has the following determinants:
deaths, population, score, 1dose (rate: at least 1 dose), full (rate: fully vaccinated), booster (rate: booster given).

Vaccine rates such as 1dose, full, and booster are unreliable 
since some countries do not often update.

The current program checks the last 8 days in the dataset.

Data is scraped from the following site:
