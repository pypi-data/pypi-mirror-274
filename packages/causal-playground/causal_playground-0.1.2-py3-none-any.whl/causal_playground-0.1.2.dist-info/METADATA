# Overview
The [CausalPlayground](https://github.com/sa-and/CausalPlayground) library serves as a tool for causality research, focusing on the interactive exploration of structural 
causal models (SCMs). It provides extensive functionality for creating, manipulating and sampling SCMs, seamlessly 
integrating them with the Gymnasium framework. Users have complete control over SCMs, enabling precise manipulation and
interaction with causal mechanisms. Additionally, CausalPlayground offers a range of useful helper functions for generating 
diverse instances of SCMs and DAGs, facilitating quantitative experimentation and evaluation. Notably, the library is 
optimized for (but not limited to) easy integration with reinforcement learning methods, enhancing its utility in active inference and 
learning settings. Find the complete API documentation and a quickstart guide [here](https://sa-and.github.io/CausalPlayground/).
