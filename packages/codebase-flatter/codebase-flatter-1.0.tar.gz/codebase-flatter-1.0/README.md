# Codebase Flatter

## Overview

**Codebase Flatter** is a utility tool designed to simplify the process of preparing a codebase for analysis or processing by Language Models (LMs). It achieves this by flattening the entire codebase into a single Markdown (.md) file, making it easier for the developer to provide the codebase to the LM for various tasks such as code analysis, generation, or other natural language processing (NLP) activities.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this tool is to streamline the workflow involved in providing a codebase to a LM for various tasks such as code analysis, generation, or other natural language processing (NLP) activities. By converting the codebase into a flat structure within a Markdown document, it allows developers to easily provide the codebase to the LM without the need for complex file handling or processing.

## Suggested system instructions
The file `system_instructions.txt` located on the project repository contains a suggestion of system instructions to be provided to the language model when using the codebase.md file generated by this tool. Feel free to modify it to better fit your needs.

## Features

- **Directory Structure Representation**: Generates a structured representation of each specified folder's contents, including all nested directories and files.
- **File Content Extraction**: Extracts and includes the content of each file within the specified folders, facilitating direct analysis or processing by LMs.
- **Output in Markdown Format**: Outputs the flattened codebase in a Markdown file, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of tools and platforms that support Markdown.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. This tool requires Python 3.x.

### Installation

This project is intended to be run directly without installation. Simply clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.

### Usage

Run the script with the `--folders` argument followed by the paths to the base folders you wish to process. For example:
`python3 flatten_codebase.py --folders /path/to/folder1 /path/to/folder2`


This will create a `codebase.md` file containing the flattened structure and content of the specified folders.
