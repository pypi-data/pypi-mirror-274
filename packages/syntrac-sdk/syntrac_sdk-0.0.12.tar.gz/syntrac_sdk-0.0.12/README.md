# syntrac-sdk

Syntracâ€™s Python SDK allows you to easily start monitoring and debugging your LLM execution. Tracing is done in a non-intrusive way, built on top of OpenTelemetry. You can choose to export the traces to Syntrac, or to your existing observability stack.

Please visit [Syntrac Python Sdk documentation](https://docs.syntrac.dev/libraries/python/getting-started) for details.
