The Python has long maintained the philosophy of "batteries included", giving the user
a rich standard library, avoiding the need for third party tools for most work. Some packages
are so common, that the have a similar status to the standard library. Still, some code seems
to be written time and again, with every project. This small library, with minimal requirements,
hopes to stop this repetition.
