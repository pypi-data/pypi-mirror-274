# amiclimate
NLP and semantic software and material for managing climate knowledge

Python code for accessing and transforming key climate documents. A refactoring of the (bloated) `pyamihtml` repository. Will initially have functionality for downloading and parsing 
* IPCC reports
* IPCC glossary
* UNFCCC reports (COP, etc.)

This requires bespoke library routines and these are available in a new `amilib` repository.

This repository will NOT have the complete IPCC or UNFCCC corpus , but will have small exemplars.

# tests
Applications are developed as tests, and then factored into command
