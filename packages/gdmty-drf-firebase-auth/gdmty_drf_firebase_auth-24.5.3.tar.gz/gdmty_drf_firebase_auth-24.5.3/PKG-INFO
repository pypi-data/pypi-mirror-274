                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and

              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# gdmty-drf-firebase-auth

Firebase backend to receive a user idToken and authenticate via Django REST Framework 
'authentication.BaseAuthentication'. Optionally, a new local user can be created in the process. 
This project is basen on the original work of 
https://github.com/garyburgmann/drf-firebase-auth but with many own contribs to allow 
get a few features that don't have the original work, but was not able to make a pull reques or 
contribs because the use cases can be so specific and  will make breaking changes to original code

## Requirements

* Python 3
* Django 4
* Django Rest Framework 3 
* Firebase Admin SDK

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install gdmty-drf-firebase-auth
```

## Configuration

Add the application to your project's `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py`.

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ...
    'gdmty_drf_firebase_auth',
    ...
]
```

### General settings

In your project's `settings.py`, add this to the `REST_FRAMEWORK` configuration. Note that if you want to retain access to the browsable API for locally created users, then you will probably want to keep `rest_framework.authentication.SessionAuthentication` too.

```python
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
  # ...
  'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': [
    # ...
    'rest_framework.authentication.SessionAuthentication',  # Optional, better to remove for production
    'rest_framework.authentication.BasicAuthentication',  # Optional, better to remove for production
    'gdmty_drf_firebase_auth.authentication.FirebaseAuthentication',
  ]
}
```

The `gdmty_drf_firebase_auth` application comes with the following settings as default, which can be overridden in your project's `settings.py` file. For convenience, most of these can be conveniently set form environment variables also. Make sure to nest them within `DEFAULT_FIREBASE_AUTH_CONFIG` as below:

```python
DEFAULT_FIREBASE_AUTH_CONFIG = {
    # allow creation of new local user in db
    'FIREBASE_CREATE_LOCAL_USER': True,
    # attempt to split firebase user.display_name and set local user, first_name and last_name
    'FIREBASE_ATTEMPT_CREATE_WITH_DISPLAY_NAME': False,
    # Authorization header prefix, commonly JWT or Bearer (e.g. Bearer <token>)
    'FIREBASE_AUTH_HEADER_PREFIX': 'Bearer',
    # verify that JWT has not been revoked
    'FIREBASE_CHECK_JWT_REVOKED': True,
    # require that firebase user.email_verified is True
    'FIREBASE_AUTH_EMAIL_VERIFICATION': False,
    # function should accept firebase_admin.auth.UserRecord as argument and return str
    'FIREBASE_USERNAME_MAPPING_FUNC': map_firebase_uid_to_username
}
```

You can get away with leaving all the settings as default

### Firebase per-project settings

It is required to have GCP service accounts, the original project only supports one; the original code has been modified to allow more than one service account, To configure the service accounts, the following configuration must be added in the `settings.py` file of your project, where each element corresponds to a project and in turn, its respective service account.

`BASE_DIR` is the root of your project, where manage.py lives. We assume that you have a folder called `sa` in the root of your project, and that you have placed your service account keyfiles there. You can change this to wherever you like.

```python
import os
BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))))

...

FIREBASE_AUTH_SA_KEYFILES = {
    'project-1': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'sa', 'project-1-keyfile.json'),
    'project-2': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'sa', 'project-2-keyfile.json')
}

FIREBASE_AUTH_PROJECTS = [
    {'PROJECT_ID': 'project-1', 'SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY': FIREBASE_AUTH_SA_KEYFILES['project-1']},
    {'PROJECT_ID': 'project-2', 'SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY': FIREBASE_AUTH_SA_KEYFILES['project-2']},
]
```

Now that you have configured the application, run the migrations so that the Firebase data can be stored.

```bash
(venv) $ ./manage.py migrate gdmty_drf_firebase_auth
```

All you need to do now is have your client code handle the Firebase popup/redirect authentication flow, retrieve the idToken from the currentUser (Firebase explains this flow well in their docs: `https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/verify-id-tokens`), and then use the idToken for the user in an `Authorization` header in requests to your API.

```javascript
Bearer <token>
```

Now, all is ready!

## Contributing

* Please raise an issue/feature and name your branch 'feature-n' or 'issue-n', where 'n' is the issue number.
* If you test this code with a Python version not listed above and all is well, please fork and update the README to include the Python version you used :)

## Additional Notes

* This project is a fork of drf-firebase-auth, which seems no longer maintained. The original project only supports one service account, the original code has been modified to allow more than one service account.
* The initial proposal of this project had the option of use Firebase Auth with email and password, but this option was removed to keep the project clean and simple, and focused on the use of Firebase Auth with idToken for Django REST Framework.
* If you are looking for a project that supports Firebase Auth with email and password, you can use our side project: `gdmty-django-firebase-auth-email-password` at https://github.com/SIGAMty/gdmty-django-firebase-auth-email-password
* I almost always setup Django with a custom user class inheriting from AbstractUser, where I switch the USERNAME_FIELD to be 'email'. This backend is set up to assign a username still anyway, but if there are any issues, please raise them and/or make a pull request to help the community!
