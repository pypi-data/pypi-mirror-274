# G-Label

A FastAPI-based image classification application for annotation. This package allows users to set an image folder, classify images into different categories, and provides an undo feature to correct mistakes. It is designed for fast and efficient annotation workflows.

## Installation

To install the package, ensure you have Python 3.6 or later installed. You can install `glabel` from PyPi using `pip`:

```bash
pip install glabel
```

## Usage
Once installed, you can start the FastAPI application using the CLI command `glabel`:
```bash
glabel
```
This will start a FastAPI server, usually running on http://127.0.0.1:8000/. Open this URL in a web browser to access the application.

## Setting the Folder and Classes
- Open [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) in a browser.
- Use the provided form to set the folder where your images are stored.
- Enter the classes/categories for classification as a comma-separated list.

## Classifying Images
After setting the image folder and classes:

1. Click the "Go to Classify" link to start the classification process.
2. You will see an image displayed in a consistent container with classification buttons below it.
3. Click the appropriate button to classify the image into that category.
4. After classification, the next image is automatically displayed for further classification.

## Undoing a Classification
If you need to undo the last classification:

- Click the "Undo Last Classification" button, which appears beside the classification buttons.
- The previously classified image will be restored to its original state, allowing you to reclassify it.
