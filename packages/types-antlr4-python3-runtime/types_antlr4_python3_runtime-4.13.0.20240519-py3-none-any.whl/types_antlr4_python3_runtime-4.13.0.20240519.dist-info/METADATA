## Typing stubs for antlr4-python3-runtime

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`antlr4-python3-runtime`](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`antlr4-python3-runtime`.

This version of `types-antlr4-python3-runtime` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `antlr4-python3-runtime==4.13.*`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/antlr4-python3-runtime. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `5445a4a243f5e41c9b4ab8b4ffa93da0820218bb` and was tested
with mypy 1.10.0, pyright 1.1.363, and
pytype 2024.4.11.
