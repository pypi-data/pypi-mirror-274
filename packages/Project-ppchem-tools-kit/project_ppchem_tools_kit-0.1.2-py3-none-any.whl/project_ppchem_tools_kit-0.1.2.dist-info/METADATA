### 2. üì• Clone the Repository
Next, clone the repository using the following command (replace *username* with your GitHub username):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/*username*/Project-ppchem-tools-kit.git
```

### 3. ‚¨áÔ∏è Install with pip
You can also install Tools Kit using pip:

```bash
pip install Project_ppchem-tools-kit
```

## üöÄ Usage
<a id="usage"></a>

To use Tools Kit and access its features, follow these steps after cloning the repository:

### Using Jupyter Notebook:

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook by navigating to the cloned repository directory in your terminal and running the command:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. In the Jupyter Notebook interface, navigate to the `notebooks` directory.

3. Open the notebook named `project_report.ipynb`.

4. Follow the instructions inside the notebook to interact with the Tools Kit interface and utilize its features for molecule analysis, graph plotting, error calculation, and more.
This notebook provides an interactive environment for convenient usage of Tools Kit directly within Visual Studio Code.


### Usage with Visual Studio Code:

1. Open Visual Studio Code and navigate to the cloned directory.

2. Install the Jupyter extension if not already installed. You can do this by searching for "Jupyter" in the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X) and installing the "Python" extension pack.

3. Open the `notebooks` directory in Visual Studio Code.

4. Open the notebook named `project_report.ipynb`.

5. Follow the instructions inside the notebook to interact with the Tools Kit interface and utilize its features for molecule analysis, graph plotting, error calculation, and more.
This notebook provides an interactive environment for convenient usage of Tools Kit with Jupyter Notebook.

## üß™ Features

1. üß¨ Molecule Name
   - Input: Raw formula of the molecule
   - Output: SMILES of the molecule

2. ‚öñÔ∏è Molecular Weight
   - Input: SMILES of the molecule
   - Output: Corresponding molar mass in g/mol

3. üìà Linear Regression
   - Input: Excel document (imported by pressing the Browse button)
   - Output: Linear regression graph with the R<sup>2</sup> value

4. üìä Graph Maker
   - Input: Excel document with x and y values arranged in two columns
   - Output: Graph plotting all values
      - Options: The graph allows customization of various parameters such as changing scales, axis labels, title, displaying maximum values, enabling gridlines, adjusting line types and colors, modifying grid and label axes, and background color.


5. üìâ Error Propagation
   - Input: Variables, their values, and their uncertainties.
   - Output: Mean value, its uncertainty, and the result can be copied as LaTeX code for easy inclusion in documents.

6. üß™ Show Molecule
   - Input: SMILES
   - Output: Molecular structure

The graphs in sections 3 and 4 can also include input for the title and X, Y axis labels.
