An unofficial Python API that let you search, browse and download Android apps from Google Play Store.

## Installation

```bash
pip install python-gpapi2
```

## Usage

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Currently, this API is still in development. The API may change in the future.
>
> Many features are not yet implemented at this time, I will continue to work on it.

```python
from gpapi2 import GooglePlayAPI

gpapi = GooglePlayAPI(email="example@gmail.com")
# See README.md section "Obtaining the Google Play Store token" for more information
gpapi.login(aas_token="aas_et/AKpp...")

# Get the details of an app
# NOTE: The method currently returns a JSON string, you can use the
# `json.loads` to convert it to a Python dictionary. I will change it
# to return a user-friendly object in the future.
details = gpapi.details("com.whatsapp")

# Get the version of an app
version, version_code = gpapi.latest_version("com.whatsapp")

# Get the download link of an app
download_link = gpapi.download_url("com.whatsapp", version_code)
```

### Obtaining the Google Play Store token

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please ensure to protect the **OAuth Token** or **AAS Token** obtained below and
> do not disclose it to anyone, as this could put your Google account at risk.

To use this API, you need to obtain a Google Play Store token. You can do this by
following these steps:

1. First, you need to obtain an **OAuth token**. You can do this by opening the
   following URL in your browser:

    <https://accounts.google.com/embedded/setup/v2/android>

    And then:

    - Open the developer console in your browser (F12)

    - Log in with your Google account on the page that appears.

    - If the **Google Terms of Services** page appears, accept it. (It can hang up
      but it's normal)

    - Go to the `Application` tab of the developer console.

    - Expand the `Cookies` section and select the `https://accounts.google.com` entry.

    - There should be a cookie named `oauth_token`. Copy its value. This is your
      **OAuth token**. (It should look like `oauth2_4/0AdL...`)

    - This token can be used only once.

2. Then, you need to obtain an **AAS token**. Run the following code:

    ```python
    from gpapi2 import GooglePlayAPI

    email = "example@gmail.com"
    oauth_token = "oauth2_4/0AdL..."
    aas_token = GooglePlayAPI.request_aas_token(email, oauth_token)
    print(aas_token)
    ```

    You should see a long string of characters. This is your **AAS token**.
    It should looks like this: `aas_et/AKpp...j25Q`
