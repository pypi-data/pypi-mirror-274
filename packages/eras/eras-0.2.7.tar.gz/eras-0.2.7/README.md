# Install
`pip install eras`

# Use
The first use of Eras will prompt you to enter an OpenAI key, which it will save to your profile as `ERAS_OPENAI_KEY`

The first use will also prompt you to allow accessibility features for Terminal.app, which is required to allow Eras to populate
the terminal with the shell command.

When you ask Eras a question, it will use AI to create a shell command, then populate your next terminal line with the command, so all you have to do is review and press enter.

## Examples
```
% eras list files
% ls
...
% eras create a new file named jason.txt with contents "hello world"
% echo "hello world" > jason.txt
...

```
