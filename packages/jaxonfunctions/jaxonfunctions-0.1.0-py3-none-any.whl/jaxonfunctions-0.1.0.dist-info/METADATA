# Jaxonfunctions

This is a collection of functions for JAX. This library uses [jaxtyping](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/jaxtyping/tree/main)
and [beartype](https://github.com/beartype/beartype) for type checking and type hinting. This ensures that the functions
are well-typed and that the types are checked at runtime.
