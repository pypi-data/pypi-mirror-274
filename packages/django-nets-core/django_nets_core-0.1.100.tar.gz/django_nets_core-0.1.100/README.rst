USAGE
_____


.. code-block:: python

    # this already include csrf_exempt for API requests
    from nets_core.decorators import request_handler
    from nets_core.params import RequestParam
    from django.http import JsonResponse

    from .models import MyModel

    @request_handler(
        MyModel, # model that you want to use if view requires it, this return 404 if not found and check ownership or permissions test in can_do param
        index_field='id' # field that will be used to get object from model, default is 'id',

        # params list that you want to get from request
        # this will be validated and converted to python types
        # if something is missing or wrong type, error will be raised
        # if public is True, this will be public in API and auth is not required
        # ensure you set you authentication methods in settings include OAuth2
        params=[
            RequestParam('name', str, optional=False),
        ],
        public=False, # default is False
        can_do='myapp.can_delete_object', # this will be check permission to do action, if not passed, only owner of object can do action, if permission does not exists will be created
        perm_required=False, # default is False, this will check if user has permission to do action or is owner of object, if set to TRUE only acces will be granted if can_do is passed

    )
    def my_view(request):
        # do something
        return JsonResponse({'ok': True})
        

Cache is required for verification code:
check https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/cache/ and pick your preference 
cache engine and set it in settings.py.

.. code-block:: python

    CACHES = {
        'default': {
        'BACKEND': 'django.core.cache.backends.memcached.PyMemcacheCache',
        'LOCATION': '127.0.0.1:11211'
        }

    }

NETS_CORE SETTINGS
__________________

Enabled multi project support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python

    NETS_CORE_PROJECT_MODEL = 'myapp.MyProjectModel'
    NETS_CORE_PROJECT_MEMBER_MODEL = 'myapp.MyProjectMemberModel'

Note that both models should be defined in your settings file. Both require def __str__(self): to be defined.
If enabled roles and permissions will be check over project and membership enabled	
example of models:

.. code-block:: python

    from nets_core.models import OwnedModel, NetsCoreBaseModel
    # use of OwnedModel is optional, but recommended to include user, created and updated fields, 
    # if not used, include user, created and updated fields in your model
    class MyProjectModel(OwnedModel):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
        enabled = models.BooleanField(default=True)
        description = models.TextField(blank=True, null=True)
        created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
        updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)

        def __str__(self):
            return self.name

    class MyProjectMemberModel(OwnedModel):
        project = models.ForeignKey(MyProjectModel, on_delete=models.CASCADE)        
        is_superuser = models.BooleanField(default=False)
        enabled = models.BooleanField(default=True)
        created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
        updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)

        def __str__(self):
            return f'{self.user} - {self.project}'

Setting  is_superuser to True will give user superuser permissions over project, OwnedModel is Abstract model that include user, created and updated fields

.. warning::

    NetsCoreBaseModel is an abstract model that include created and updated fields and implements to_json method that allow to serialize model to json
    passing fields as tuple to include or "__all__" to include. This is a store function in database for fast access to json data.
    TODO: include examples of use to serialize model to json based on fields required per view or endpoint. Inspired in Facebook GraphQL


Set verification code expire time
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python

    NETS_CORE_VERIFICATION_CODE_EXPIRE_SECONDS = 15*60 # 900 seconds

Set email footer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python

    NETS_CORE_EMAIL_FOOTER_ENABLED = True 
    NETS_CORE_EMAIL_FOOTER = '<p>Thank you for using our service </p>' # html email footer
    NETS_CORE_EMAIL_FOOTER_TEMPLATE = 'myapp/email_foote.html' # template to use for email footer


.. warning::
    
    If NETS_CORE_EMAIL_FOOTER_TEMPLATE is set, NETS_CORE_EMAIL_FOOTER will be ignored


Set email debug
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Enable sent emails while settings.DEBUG is True, default to False. Enable if you want sent emails in development
.. code-block:: python

    NETS_CORE_EMAIL_DEBUG_ENABLED = True


Set excluded domains
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sometimes you want to exclude some domains from sent emails to avoid spamming, like temporary emails or testing domains
like service providers as mailinator.com, temp-mail.org, guerillamail.com, emailondeck.com, ironmail.com, cloakmail.com, 10minutemail.com, 33mail.com, maildrop.cc, etc.

.. code-block:: python

    NETS_CORE_EMAIL_EXCLUDE_DOMAINS = ['mailinator.com', 'temp-mail.org', 'guerillamail.com', 'emailondeck.com', 'ironmail.com', 'cloakmail.com', '10minutemail.com', '33mail.com', 'maildrop.cc']

This will avoid to send emails to these domains: example user request access with me@guerillamail.com will not receive any email


Set verification code cache key
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Set cache key to store verification code, default is 'NC_T'
.. code-block:: python

    NETS_CORE_VERIFICATION_CODE_CACHE_KEY = 'NC_T'

Set prohibited fields
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

nets_core.auth_urls provide endpoints to update user model fields, you can exclude some fields from being updated by auth.urls

Set fields that should not be updated by auth.urls

.. code-block:: python

    prohibited_fields = [
        "password",
        "is_superuser",
        "is_staff",
        "is_active",
        "verified",
        "email_verified",
        "last_login",
        "date_joined",
        "updated_fields",
        "groups",
        "user_permissions",
        "doc_*",
    ]
    # set this in your settings.py to exclude fields from user model to be updated by auth.urls
    NETS_CORE_USER_PROHIBITED_FIELDS = prohibited_fields


Include nets_core.auth_urls
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To enabled authentication provided by nets_core include auth.urls in your project urls.py

.. code-block:: python
    
    from django.urls import path, include

    urlpatterns = [
        ...
        path("", include("nets_core.auth_urls", namespace="auth")),
        ...
    ]


Enabled testers for tests or third party verifications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Enabling testers will allow test autentication without receiving email verification code, for this to work
you need to set the following settings

.. code-block:: python

    NETS_CORE_TESTERS_EMAILS = ['google_testers234*', 'tester1@myappdomain.com']
    NETS_CORE_TESTERS_VERIFICATION_CODE = '475638'


NETS_CORE_TESTERS_EMAILS is a list of emails that will be allowed to authenticate without receiving email verification code
this could end with \* to allow all emails that start with the string before the \*, for production use a strong string and different for each project 
and environment, to avoid unauthorized access

NETS_CORE_TESTERS_VERIFICATION_CODE is the verification code that will be used to authenticate testers

.. warning::

    Use a unique and strong string emails and verification code for each project and environment to avoid unauthorized access


Customize account deletion template
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To customize the account deletion email template, create a template in your project templates folder
and set the path in settings.py

.. code-block:: python

    NETS_CORE_DELETE_ACCOUNT_TEMPLATE = 'myapp/account_deletion.html'

This will  include and info template in account deletion view.


.. warning::

    If NETS_CORE_DELETE_ACCOUNT_TEMPLATE is not set not info template will be included in account deletion view




.. code-block:: python

    # login url accept device to link verification code to device
     valid_device_fields = [
        "name",
        "os",
        "os_version",
        "device_token",
        "firebase_token",
        "app_version",
        "device_id",
        "device_type",
    ]

valid_device_fields is use to update or create device
if uuid is provided, device will be updated, otherwise created
if invalid uuid is provided, error will be raised


DJANGO SETTINGS
