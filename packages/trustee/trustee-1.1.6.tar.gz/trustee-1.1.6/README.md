Getting Started
---------------

This section contains basic information and instructions to get started with Trustee.

### Python Version

Trustee supports `Python >=3.7`.

### Install Trustee

Use the following command to install Trustee:

```
$ pip install trustee
```

### Sample Code

```
from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

from trustee import ClassificationTrustee

X, y = datasets.load_iris(return_X_y=True)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.30)

clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

trustee = ClassificationTrustee(expert=clf)
trustee.fit(X_train, y_train, num_iter=50, num_stability_iter=10, samples_size=0.3, verbose=True)
dt, pruned_dt, agreement, reward = trustee.explain()
dt_y_pred = dt.predict(X_test)

print("Model explanation global fidelity report:")
print(classification_report(y_pred, dt_y_pred))
print("Model explanation score report:")
print(classification_report(y_test, dt_y_pred))
```
