# Otonagai-dl

Otonagai is a CLI-based app that keeps track of your favourite merchandise from anime/video games/ manga/ comic books from HobbyLinkJapan.

Originally, this was being made to keep track of build progress of gunpla (Gundam Model Kits), but I thought it would be better to expand it to action figures and other merch available.

# Installation

You can install the app through pip in Python by using

```
pip install otonagai-dl
```

After installing the package locally, go into your terminal of choice by typing

```
otonagai-dl
```

and press "Enter".
