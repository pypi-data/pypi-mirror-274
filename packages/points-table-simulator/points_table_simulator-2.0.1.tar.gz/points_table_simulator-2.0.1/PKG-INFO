import pandas as pd

# Load the tournament schedule DataFrame
tournament_schedule = pd.read_csv("tournament_schedule.csv")

# Note:

#   - "match_number" column containing the match number
#   - "home" column containing the home team names
#   - "away" column containing the away team names

simulator = PointsTableSimulator(
    tournament_schedule=tournament_schedule,
    points_for_a_win=3,
    points_for_a_no_result=1,
    points_for_a_draw=1
)

# Get the current points table
current_table = simulator.current_points_table      # current_points_table is an attribute of PointsTableSimulator class

# Simulate qualification scenarios for a specific team
points_tables, qualification_match_results = simulator.simulate_the_qualification_scenarios(
    team_name="Team A",
    top_x_position_in_the_table=4,
    desired_number_of_scenarios=5
